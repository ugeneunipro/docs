To select an active view click on the view area or select an appropriate value in the _Active view_ combo box on the toolbar.

To synchronize the views press the _Synchronize 3D Structure Views_ sticky button on the toolbar (see the image above). When the button has been pressed the 3D structures are [_moved, zoomed and spinned_](65929540.html) synchronously. Press the button again to stop the views synchronization.

The views that are no more required can be closed by selecting the _Close_ button in the 3D Structure Viewer context menu.

Also you can hide/show views for a while. Use the menu of the green arrow button on the toolbar to do it:

Notice that the 3D Structure Viewer can be closed from this menu.
