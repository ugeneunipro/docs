# Project View

The _Project View_ shows documents and bookmarks of the current _project_. The documents are files added to the project. And the bookmarks are visual view states of the documents. Read [_Using Bookmarks_](using-bookmarks.md) to learn more about bookmarks.

To show/hide the _Project View_, click the _Project_ button in the main UGENE window:

You can also use the Alt+1 hotkey to show/hide the _Project View_.

To create a new project, refer to [_Creating New Project_](creating-new-project.md). Note that if you have no project created when opening file with a sequence, an alignment or any other biological data, a new anonymous project is created automatically.
