The following parameters are available:

- _Export to file_ - the output file path.
- _File format_ - the format of the output file. The possible values depend on the mode selected for the consensus calculation. For _Default_ and _ClustalW_ modes, only the _Plain text_ value is available. For _Levitsky_, _Simple extended_, and _Strict_ consensus modes, sequence formats FASTA and GenBank are also available.

Click on the _Export_ button to export the consensus sequence to the specified output file.
