# ChIP-Seq Coverage

This workflow sample prepares ChIP-Seq processed data (using **BedTools** and **bedGraphToBigWig**) for visualization in
a genome browser.
Given a BED file as input, it produces a **BigWig** file.

## How to Use This Sample

If you haven't used workflow samples in UGENE before, check the section:
"[How to Use Sample Workflows](../../introduction/how-to-use-sample-workflows)"

### Workflow Sample Location

The sample **"ChIP-Seq Coverage"** is available in the **"NGS"** section of the Workflow Designer.

### Workflow Image

The opened workflow looks like this:
