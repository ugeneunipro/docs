# Removing All Columns of Gaps

Use the _Shift+Del_ or _Edit â€£ Remove all columns of gaps_ item in the _Actions_ main menu or in the context menu to remove all columns of gaps from the alignment. This can be useful, for example, when an insertion in a read turned out not to be real, it was replaced by a gap, and a column of gaps was left in the alignment.
