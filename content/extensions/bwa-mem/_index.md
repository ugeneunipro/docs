# BWA-MEM

_BWA_ is a fast, lightweight tool designed to align relatively short reads to a reference sequence. Click [this link](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) to open the _BWA_ homepage. BWA-MEM is generally recommended for high-quality queries, as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also performs better than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

Open the _Tools â€£ Align to reference_ submenu from the main menu.

Select the _Align short reads_ item to align short reads to a DNA sequence using _BWA-MEM_. Alternatively, select the _Build index_ item to build an index for a DNA sequence, which can be used to optimize the alignment of short reads.
