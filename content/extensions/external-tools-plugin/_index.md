# External Tools Plugin

The _External Tools_ plugin allows one to launch an external tool from UGENE.

To use an external tool from UGENE, the tool needs to be installed on the system and the path to it should be properly configured. However, there is no need in the additional configuration, if you’ve installed the UGENE Full Package, as it already contains all the tools by default.

Otherwise, if you’ve installed the UGENE Standard Package, you would need to configure an external tool in order to use it. Note that in this case you can download the package with all the external tools from [this page](http://ugene.unipro.ru/external.html).

To learn how to configure an external tool, read below.
