The following parameters are available:

_Distance algorithm -_ there are two distance algorithms: "Hamming distance" for dissimilarity and "Simple similarity" for similarity.

_Profile mode: Counts/Percents_ — select the _Percents_ to have scores shown as percents in the report. Also, you can _Exclude gaps_.

_Show group statistics of multiple alignment_ - shows group statistics when the collapsing is switched on.

_Save profile to file_ — allows saving the profile to a file in the HTML or CSV format. The CSV format is convenient for further processing in worksheets editors like Excel.

The resulting profile in the HTML mode:
