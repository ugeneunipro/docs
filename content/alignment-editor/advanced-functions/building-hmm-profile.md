# Building HMM Profile

The editor has capabilities to build a Hidden Markov Model profile based on the multiple sequence alignment.

This functionality is based on the [Sean Eddy’s HMMER](http://hmmer.janelia.org/) package.

To build a HMM profile select the _Advanced ‣ Build HMMER2 profile_ or the _Advanced ‣ Build HMMER3 profile_ item in the _Actions_ main menu or in the context menu.

Learn more about the HMM tool in the documentation pages of the [_HMM2_](hmm2.md) and the [_HMM3_](hmm3.md) plugins.
