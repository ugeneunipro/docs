# Export Highlighting to File

![](/images/96666040/96666045.png)

Select the output file to export the highlighting, choose the area to be exported, and click on the _Export_ button. The task report will appear in the _[Notifications](../../../basic-functions/ugene-window-components/notifications)_.

Additionally, you may set the following parameters:

*   **Indexing** - choose the number to start counting from:
    *   _1-based_ - the first column is numbered **1**,
    *   _0-based_ - the first column is numbered **0**.
*   **Keep gaps** - check this option to retain gap symbols in the result file.
*   **Dots instead of not highlighted** - replace non-highlighted bases with dots in the result file.
*   **Transpose output** - if this checkbox is checked, the sequences will be arranged horizontally (not vertically, as in UGENE). This may be useful if you have a long alignment but not many sequences.
