# Query Designer Schema File Format

Using the GUI is not the only way to create or edit a _schema_. As specified [_earlier_](../manipulating-schema/saving-schema), a schema is saved to a file with a \*.uql extension. This chapter describes the format of the file and explains how you can create or edit a schema file using a text editor.

The best way to learn the schema file format is to study an existing \*.uql file. For example, letâ€™s take the sample schema file described in the [_example_](../query-designer-introduction/how-to-create-and-run-schema). Open the file in a text editor. In the image below, you can see the file opened in MS WordPad.

The file consists of the header and the body. Check the description of each part below.
