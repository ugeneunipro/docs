# Inserting Gap

To insert a gap into a read in the _Sanger Reads Editor,_ select a character or a gap in the corresponding location in the _Chromatogram Area_ and press _Space,_ select _Edit_â€“>_Insert gap_ in the context menu, or _Actions->Edit->Insert gap_ in the main menu.

By holding the _Space_ key, you can shift a Sanger read to the right. To shift the read to the left, hold the _Backspace_ key. See the [Removing Gap at the Left](removing-gap-at-the-left) chapter.

You can always cancel the changes by pressing _Ctrl+Z_.
