# Managing of Elements Parameters

The parameters values can be edited for the both _algorithm_ and _constraint_ elements.

When you select an _element_ on the _Scene_, itâ€™s description and parameters appear in the _Property Editor_.

There are some common parameters:

*   _Element Name_ sets the name of the current element.
*   _Annotate As_ sets the name of the result annotations.
*   _Direction_ specifies the direction of the current element relatively to other elements in the schema (i.e. either the result must be searched in the current strand of the input sequence or in the reverse complementary strand). To learn more read [_Managing Strands_](managing-strands.md).

Other parameters can be found in the _Parameters_ area. Depending on the parameter in question, the value is selected either from a drop-down list or a spinbox, etc.
