# Calculating Molecular Surface

To calculate the molecular surface of a molecule, select the _Molecular Surface_ item in the 3D Structure Viewer context menu or in the _Display_ menu on the toolbar and choose one of the following options:

* _SAS_ (solvent-accessible surface)
* _SES_ (solvent-excluded surface)
* _vdWS_ (van der Waals surface)

To remove the molecular surface that has already been calculated, select the _Off_ item.

You can also select the _Molecular Surface Render Style_ to modify the calculated molecular surface's appearance:

* _Convex Map_
* _Dots_
