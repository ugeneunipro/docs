# Transform into a primer pair

UGENE has certain primers format. It allows one to use some features, which are avaliable only if this format is being recognized. Examples of thes features:

*   Create PCR Fragment,
*   [Primer-BLAST](primer-blast.md).

If you have a primer pair, which doesn't fit to this format, these features will be unavaliable for you. To fix this issue:

1.  Select your own left and right primers.
2.  Click right mouse button → Edit → Transform into a primer pair.
