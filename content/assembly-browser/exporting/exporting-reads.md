Select a file to export the read to and choose the file format. The read can be exported either to a FASTA or FASTQ file.

When the parameters are set, click the _Export_ button.

The read is exported to the file, and if the _Add to project_ checkbox is checked, it is added to the current _project_ from where you can _open_ it.
