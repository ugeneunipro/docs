# Moving, Zooming, and Spinning 3D Structure

A 3D structure can be easily spun, moved, and resized:

* To spin the 3D structure, drag the mouse on the 3D structure while holding the left mouse button.
* To move the 3D structure, hold the Ctrl key and drag the mouse with the left button pressed.
* To resize the 3D structure, use the mouse wheel or the _Zoom In_ and _Zoom Out_ buttons on the toolbar.

At any time, you can restore the default view by pressing the _Restore Default View_ button on the toolbar.

You can also view the entire structure by spinning it automatically. Select the _Spin_ item either in the 3D Structure Viewer context menu or in the _Display_ menu on the toolbar to do it.

To stop the spinning, uncheck the _Spin_ item.
