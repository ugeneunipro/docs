# Opening 3D Structure Viewer

The _3D Structure Viewer_ is opened automatically when you open a PDB or MMDB file.

For example, [_open_](http://ugene.unipro.ru/documentation/manual/basic_functions/opening_document.html#opening-document) $UGENE/data/samples/PDB/1CF7.PDB. The 3D Structure Viewer adds a view to the upper part of the _Sequence View_:

Notice the _Links_ button on the toolbar. When you click the button the menu appears with quick links to online resources with detailed information about the molecule opened:

*   PDB Wiki
*   RSCB PDB
*   PDBsum
*   NCBI MMDB

Note that if you’re online, you can access the Protein Data Bank directly from UGENE and load a required file by its PDB ID (see [_Fetching Data from Remote Database_](fetching-data-from-remote-database.md) for details).

Hint

Don’t forget to select the correct database (PDB) while fetching.
