Choose a file with the sequence(s) from the files system, and click _Open_.

Also, you can add an already opened sequence or sequences to the alignment. To do it, select the sequence object(s) in the [Project View](ugene-terminology.md) and click the _Align sequence to this alignment_ toolbar button. The sequence(s) will be aligned to the alignment automatically.
