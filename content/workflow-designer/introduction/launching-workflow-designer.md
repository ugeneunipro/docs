The output directory is a common directory used to store all output files in the Workflow Designer. If this directory is used, a separate subdirectory is created for each run of a workflow. You can change this option in the [_Application Settings_](ugene-components-and-workflow-designer/application-settings) dialog.

The tool provides a multi-window user interface, so you can open and use as many Workflow Designer windows as you need simultaneously.
