# Show on Translation

This option is available for nucleotide sequences only. It specifies that the annotation should be displayed on the corresponding amino acid sequence instead of the original nucleotide sequence in the _Sequence Detailed View_, for example:

You can enable or disable this option by checking or unchecking the _Show on translation_ checkbox.
