# Excluding Region

To exclude a sequence region from the search check the _Exclude region_ check box and input the start and the end positions of the region. If a subsequence has been selected before opening the dialog you can see the _Selected_ _region_ field which will be filled in automatically by the values with the selected subsequenceâ€™s start and end positions.
