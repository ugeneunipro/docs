Here, you can change the size of the tree using the _Expansion_ slider and the curvature of the lines using the _Curvature_ slider.

The slider positions return to their original position by double-clicking on the field name or on the sliders.


You can also select the color and the line width of the tree branches here.

Note that when [_a clade has been selected_](../working-with-clade/selecting-clade), the branch settings _Color_ and _Line Width_ are applied to the clade only.
