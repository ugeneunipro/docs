# Opening from Clipboard

In UGENE, you can open text data and files by pasting them into the _Project View_ from the clipboard.

Select text data in a browser or a text editor, or select file(s) from your system and press _Ctrl+C (Cmd+C for macOS)_.

Switch to UGENE with an open project, click the project area, and press _Ctrl+V (Cmd+V)_.

The copied data or file(s) will be opened in UGENE.

Another way to open file(s) is by drag and drop. Using your mouse, drag and drop the files from the file system to UGENE, and they will be opened by the program.
