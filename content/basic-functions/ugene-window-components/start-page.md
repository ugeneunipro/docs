# Start Page

The _Start Page_ is the first page that appears when UGENE is launched. From this page, you can open a file, create a sequence, create a workflow (use a sample workflow or create a new one), open the Quick Start Guide, and open recent files directly.

To return to the _Start Page_ at any time, select _Help->Open Start Page_ in the main menu.
