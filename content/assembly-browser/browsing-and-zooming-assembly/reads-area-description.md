# Reads Area Description

The _Reads Area_ provides a visualization of reads of an assembly part. To zoom in or zoom out, rotate the mouse wheel.

To perform zooming you can also use the _Zoom In_ and _Zoom Out_ buttons on the toolbar or the _Actions ‣ Zoom In_ and _Actions ‣ Zoom Out_ items in the main menu.

Also, when you double-click on a read it is zoomed in and moved to the center of the window.

By dragging the mouse while holding the left mouse button you can navigate in the Reads Area.

To navigate long distances in the Reads Area use the _Assembly Overview_ described [_below_](assembly-overview-description.md).

Other ways to navigate in the assembly are:

*   Use the horizontal and vertical scroll bars of the Reads Area
*   [_Go to a specified position in an assembly_](go-to-position-in-assembly.md)

To learn about available hotkeys refer to [_Assembly Browser Hotkeys_](assembly-browser-hotkeys.md).

By default, assembly rendering is optimized while scrolling. While you are moving across an assembly, it shows the assembly in gray color, but when you stop it shows the assembly in different colors. To disable this option uncheck the _Optimize the rendering while scrolling_ item in the context menu of the _Reads Area_ or _Optimize scrolling_ item on the _Assembly Browser Settings_ tab of the _Options Panel_.
