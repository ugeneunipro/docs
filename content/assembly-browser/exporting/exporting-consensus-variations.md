Select a file, mode and the file format. The following modes are available: _Variations_, _Similar_ and _All_. Variations can be exported as to a SimpleSNP or VCFv4 file.

Modify, if required, the [_consensus algorithm_](consensus-sequence.md).

The consensus is exported with gaps if the _Keep gaps_ check box has been checked.

Also you can select the exporting region. It can be either a _Whole sequence_, a _Visible_ region, or a _Custom_ region.

When all the parameters are set click the _Export_ button.

The consensus sequence is exported to the file and if the _Add to project_ check box has been checked it is added to the current _project_ and opened.

The _Export consensus variations_ feature is available when the reference sequence is associated with assembly.
