Executable paths for external tools, which are already integrated into UGENE, can be configured in the "Supported tools" section of the "External tools" page in the "Application Settings" dialog. You can find the full list of supported tools in the "[Data Analysis Tools](../../../download-and-installation/data-analysis-tools)" chapter of the documentation.
