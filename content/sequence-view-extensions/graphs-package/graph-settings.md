The following parameters are available:

_Window_ — the number of bases in a window.

_Steps per window_ — the number of steps in window. The _Step_ is calculated as _Window_ / _Steps per window_.

_Default color_ — the default color of line of graph (or lines of graphs for _GC Frame Plot_).

Checking of the _Cutoff for minimum and maximum values_ checkbox enables the following settings:

_Minimum_ — the minimum value for cutoff.

_Maximum_ — the maximum value for cutoff.

Select an appropriate minimum and maximum value and click the _OK_ button to show the graph of cutoffs. The graph is divided into 2 parts. The upper part shows values greater than the specified _Maximum_ value. The lower part of the graph shows values lower than the specified _Minimum_ value. For example:
