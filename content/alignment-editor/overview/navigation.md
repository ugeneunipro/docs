# Navigation

The _Sequence area_ provides several flexible ways to navigate through an alignment. The simplest way is to use the mouse and the scrollbars.

Alternatively, you can use arrow keys on the keyboard to navigate.

The list of hotkeys for quick navigation:

*   PageUp — to move one screen left.
*   PageDown — to move one screen right.
*   Home — to center the starting columns of the alignment.
*   End — to move to the trailing columns of the alignment

**Hint**

if you use Shift key with the hotkeys above you will navigate through the rows. For example, Shift-PageDown will move one screen down.

Finally, you can use the _Go to position_ dialog from the _Actions_ menu, the context menu or the editor toolbar.

Enter the column number (base coordinate) and the view will be centered to the corresponding base.
