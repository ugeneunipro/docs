Five methods for building phylogenetic trees are supported:

1. The _FastTree_ method. Check the FastTree [Web Site](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/) for more details.
2. The _IQ-TREE_ method. Check the [IQ-TREE Web Site](http://www.iqtree.org/) for more details.
3. The _PHYLIP Neighbour-Joining_ method. The [PHYLIP](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) package implementation of the method is used under the hood.
4. The _MrBayes_ external tool. Check the [MrBayes Web Site](http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/) for more details.
5. The PhyML Maximum Likelihood method. Check the [PhyML Maximum Likelihood Web Site](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/) for more details.
