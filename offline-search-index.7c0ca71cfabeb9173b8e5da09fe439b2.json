Best hits (-R) — proceed with suboptimal alignments if there are no more than specified number of equally best hits. This option only affects paired-end mapping. Increasing this threshold helps to improve the pairing accuracy at the cost of speed, especially for short reads (~32bp).\nLong-scaled gap penalty for long deletion (-L) — long-scaled gap penalty for long deletion.\nNon-iterative mode (-N) — disable iterative search. All hits with no more than Max #diff differences will be found. This mode is much slower than the default.\nYou can also configure the following advanced parameters:\nEnable long gaps — checking this box allows one to set the Max gap extentions parameter.\nMax gap extensions (-e) — maximum number of gap extensions.\nIndel offset (-i) — disallow insertions and deletions within the specified number of base pairs towards the ends.\nMax long deletion extensions (-d) — disallow a long deletions within the specified number of base pairs towards the 3`-end.\nMax queue entries (-m) — maximum queue entries.\nBarcode length (-B) — length of barcode starting from the 5`-end. When the specified length is positive, the barcode of each read will be trimmed before mapping and will be written at the BC SAM tag. For paired-end reads, the barcode from both ends are concatenated.\nThreads (-t) — number of threads.\nMax seed differences (-k) — maximum edit distance in the seed.\nMismatch penalty (-M) — BWA will not search for suboptimal hits with a score lower than the specified value.\nGap open penalty (-O) — gap open penalty.\nGap extension penalty (-E) — gap extension penalty.\nQuality threshold (-q) — parameter for read trimming.\nSelect the required parameters and press the Start button.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Aligning Short Reads with BWA When you select the Tools ‣ DNA Assembly …","ref":"/extensions/bwa/aligning-short-reads-with-bwa/","tags":"","title":"Aligning Short Reads with BWA"},{"body":"Aligning Short Reads with BWA-MEM When you select the Tools ‣ Align to reference ‣ Align short reads item in the main menu, the Align Sequencing Reads dialog appears. Set value of the Align short reads method parameter to BWA-MEM. The dialog looks as follows:\nThere are the following parameters:\nReference sequence — DNA sequence to align short reads to. This parameter is required.\nResult file name — file in SAM format to write the result of the alignment into. This parameter is required.\nPrebuilt index — check this box to use an index file instead of a source reference sequence. Also you can build it manually.\nSAM output — always save the output file in the SAM format (the option is disabled for BWA).\nShort reads — each added short read is a small DNA sequence file. At least one read should be added.\nYou can also configure other parameters.\nIndex algorithm (-a) — algorithm for constructing BWA index.\nIt implements three different algorithms:\nis — designed for short reads up to ~200bp with low error rate (\u003c3%). It does gapped global alignment w.r.t. reads, supports paired-end reads, and is one of the fastest short read alignment algorithms to date while also visiting suboptimal hits. bwtsw — is designed for long reads with more errors. It performs heuristic Smith-Waterman-like alignment to find high-scoring local hits. Algorithm implemented in BWA-SW. On low-error short queries, BWA-SW. is slower and less accurate than the is algorithm, but on long reads, it is better. div — does not work for long genomes. Number of threads (-t) — number of threads.\nMin seed length (-k) — minimum seed length. Matches shorter than INT will be missed. The alignment speed is usually insensitive to this value unless it significantly deviates 20.\nBand width (-w) — band width. Essentially, gaps longer than INT will not be found. Note that the maximum gap length is also affected by the scoring matrix and the hit length, not solely determined by this option.\nDropoff (-d) — off-diagonal X-dropoff (Z-dropoff). Stop extension when the difference between the best and the current extension score is above |i-j|*A+INT, where i and j are the current positions of the query and reference, respectively, and A is the matching score. Z-dropoff is similar to BLAST’s X-dropoff except that it doesn’t penalize gaps in one of the sequences in the alignment. Z-dropoff not only avoids unnecessary extension, but also reduces poor alignments inside a long good alignment.\nInternall seeds length (-r) - trigger re-seeding for a MEM longer than minSeedLen*FLOAT. This is a key heuristic parameter for tuning the performance. Larger value yields fewer seeds, which leads to faster alignment speed but lower accuracy.\nSkip seeds threshold (-c) - discard a MEM if it has more than INT occurence in the genome. This is an insensitive parameter.\nDrop chain threshold (-D) - drop chains shorter than FLOAT fraction of the longest overlapping chain.\nRounds of mate rescues (-m) - perform at most INT rounds of mate rescues for each read.\nSkip mate rescue (-S) - skip mate rescue.\nSkip pairing (-P) - in the paired-end mode, perform SW to rescue missing hits only but do not try to find hits that fit a proper pair.\nScore for a match (-A) - matching score.\nMismatch penalty (-B) - mismatch penalty. The sequence error rate is approximately: {.75 * exp[-log(4) * B/A]}.\nGap open penalty (-O) - gap open penalty.\nGap extention penalty (-E) - gap extension penalty. A gap of length k costs O + k*E (i.e. Gap open penalty is for opening a zero-length gap).\nPenalty for clipping (-L) - clipping penalty. When performing SW extension, BWA-MEM keeps track of the best score reaching the end of query. If this score is larger than the best SW score minus the clipping penalty, clipping will not be applied. Note that in this case, the SAM AS tag reports the best SW score; clipping penalty is not deducted.\nPenalty unpaired (-U) - penalty for an unpaired read pair. BWA-MEM scores an unpaired read pair as scoreRead1+scoreRead2-INT and scores a paired as scoreRead1+scoreRead2-insertPenalty. It compares these two scores to determine whether we should force pairing.\nScore threshold (-T) - don’t output alignment with score lower than score threshold.

The main goal of the Assembly Browser is to let a user visualize and efficiently browse large next generation sequence assemblies.\nCurrently supported formats are SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and BAM, which is a binary version of the SAM format. Both formats are produced by SAMtools and described in the following specification: SAMtools. Support of other formats is also planned, so please send us a request if you’re interested in a certain format.\nTo browse an assembly data in UGENE, a BAM or SAM file should be imported to a UGENE database file. After that you can convert the UGENE database file into a SAM file. The import to a UGENE database file has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages are that the import may take time for a large file and there should be enough disk space to store the database file.\nOn the other hand, this allows one to overview the whole assembly and navigate in it rather rapidly. In addition, during the import you can select contigs to be imported from the BAM/SAM file. So, there is no need to import the whole file if you’re going to work only with some contigs. Note that in the future there are plans to support the other approach as well, namely, when a BAM/SAM file is opened directly.\nThe Assembly Browser has been tested on different BAM/SAM files from the 1000 Genomes Project and other sources.\nRead the documentation below to learn more about the Assembly Browser features.\nImport BAM and SAM Files Browsing and Zooming Assembly Opening Assembly Browser Window Assembly Browser Window Assembly Browser Window Components Reads Area Description Assembly Overview Description Ruler and Coverage Graph Description Go to Position in Assembly Using Bookmarks for Navigation in Assembly Data Getting Information About Read Short Reads Vizualization Reads Highlighting Reads Shadowing Associating Reference Sequence Associating Variations Consensus Sequence Exporting Exporting Reads Exporting Visible Reads Exporting Coverage Exporting Consensus Exporting Consensus Variations Exporting Assembly as Image Exporting Assembly Region Options Panel in Assembly Browser Navigation in Assembly Browser Assembly Statistics Assembly Browser Settings Assembly Browser Hotkeys Assembly Overview Hotkeys Reads Area Hotkeys ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Assembly Browser The UGENE Assembly Browser project started in 2010 …","ref":"/assembly-browser/","tags":"","title":"Assembly Browser"},{"body":"Assembly Browser Hotkeys Assembly Overview Hotkeys Reads Area Hotkeys ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Assembly Browser Hotkeys Assembly Overview Hotkeys Reads Area Hotkeys ","ref":"/assembly-browser/assembly-browser-hotkeys/","tags":"","title":"Assembly Browser Hotkeys"},{"body":"Assembly Browser Settings The Assembly Browser Settings tab includes Reads Area, Consensus Area and Ruler settings.\nTo learn more about Reads Area settings refer to the Reads Area Settings chapter.\nTo learn more about Consensus see the Consensus Sequence chapter.\nTo learn more about Ruler see the Browsing and Zooming Assembly chapter.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Assembly Browser Settings The Assembly Browser Settings tab includes …","ref":"/assembly-browser/options-panel-in-assembly-browser/assembly-browser-settings/","tags":"","title":"Assembly Browser Settings"},{"body":"Assembly Browser Window The opened window contains the list of well-covered regions of the assembly:\nNote that for large assemblies it may take some time to calculate the overview and the well-covered regions.\nTo see the reads, either select a region from the list or zoom in, for example, by clicking the link above the well-covered regions or by rotating the mouse wheel.\nYou can also use the hotkeys.

If an overlap contains lots of differences at bases of high quality, then the overlap is removed. The difference score is calculated as follows. If the overlap contains a difference at bases of quality values q1 and q2, then the score at the difference is max(0, min(q1, q2) - b), where b is Quality cutoff for differences. The difference score of an overlap is the sum of scores at each difference.\n200\ndiff-max-qscore\nnumeric\nMatch score factor\nMatch score factor (-m) is one of the parameters that affects similarity score of an overlap.

See Overlap similarity score cutoff description for details.\n6\ngap-penalty-factor\nnumeric\nOverlap similarity score cutoff\nIf the similarity score of an overlap is less than the overlap similarity score cutoff (-s), then the overlap is removed. The similarity score of an overlapping alignment is defined using base quality values as follows. A match at bases of quality values q1 and q2 is given a score of m * min(q1,q2), where m is Match score factor. A mismatch at bases of quality values q1 and q2 is given a score of n * min(q1,q2), where n is Mismatch score factor. A base of quality value q1 in a gap is given a score of -g * min(q1,q2), where q2 is the quality value of the base in the other sequence right before the gap and g is Gap penalty factor. The score of a gap is the sum of scores of each base in the gap minus a gap open penalty. The similarity score of an overlapping alignment is the sum of scores of each match, each mismatch, and each gap.\n900\noverlap-sim-score-cutoff\nnumeric\nOverlap length cutoff\nAn overlap is taken into account only if the length of the overlap in bp is no less than the specified value (parameter -o of CAP3).\n40\noverlap-length-cutoff\nnumeric\nOverlap percent identity cutoff\nAn overlap is taken into account only if the percent identity of the overlap is no less than the specified value (parameter -p of CAP3).\n90\noverlap-perc-id-cutoff\nnumeric\nMax number of word matches\nThis parameter allows one to trade off the efficiency of the program for its accuracy (parameter -t of CAP3). For a read f, CAP3 computes overlaps between read f and other reads by considering short word matches between read f and other reads. A word match is examined to see if it can be extended into a long overlap. If read f has overlaps with many other reads, then read f has many short word matches with many other reads. This parameter gives an upper limit, for any word, on the number of word matches between read f and other reads that are considered by CAP3. Using a large value for this parameter allows CAP3 to consider more word matches between read f and other reads, which can find more overlaps for read f, but slows down the program. Using a small value for this parameter has the opposite effect.\n300\nmax-num-word-matches\nnumeric\nBand expansion size\nCAP3 determines a minimum band of diagonals for an overlapping alignment between two sequence reads.

Set value of the Align short reads method parameter to Bowtie 2. The dialog looks as follows:\nThere are the following parameters:\nReference sequence — DNA sequence to align short reads to. This parameter is required.\nResult file name — file in SAM format to write the result of the alignment into. This parameter is required.\nLibrary - single-end or paired-end reads.\nPrebuilt index — check this box to use an index file instead of a source reference sequence. The index is a set of 6 files with suffixes .1.ebwt, .2.ebwt, .3.ebwt, .4.ebwt, .rev.1.ebwt, and .rev.2.ebwt. The index is created during the alignment. Also you can build it manually.\nSAM output — always save the output file in the SAM format (the option is disabled for Bowtie).\nShort reads — each added short read is a small DNA sequence file. At least one read should be added.\nYou can also configure other parameters. They are the same as in the original Bowtie 2 (you can read detailed description of the parameters on the Bowtie 2 manual page).\nSelect one of the following alignment modes:\nThe –end-to-end alignment mode:\nBy default, Bowtie 2 performs end-to-end read alignment. That is, it searches for alignments involving all of the read characters. This is also called an “untrimmed” or “unclipped” alignment.\nWhen the –local option is specified, Bowtie 2 performs local read alignment. In this mode, Bowtie 2 might “trim” or “clip” some read characters from one or both ends of the alignment if doing so maximizes the alignment score.\nThe following parameters are available:\nNumber of mismatches (–N) — sets the number of mismatches to allowed in a seed alignment during multiseed alignment. Can be set to 0 or 1. Setting this higher makes alignment slower (often much slower) but increases sensitivity.\nSeed length (–L) — Sets the length of the seed substrings to align during multiseed alignment. Smaller values make alignment slower but more senstive.\nAdd columns to allow gaps (–dpad) — “Pads” dynamic programming problems by \u003cint\u003e columns on either side to allow gaps.\nDisallow gaps (–gbar) — disallow gaps within \u003cint\u003e positions of the beginning or end of the read.\nSeed (–seed) — use \u003cint\u003e as the seed for pseudo-random number generator.\nThe following flags are available:\nNo unpaired alignments (–no-mixed) — by default, when bowtie2 cannot find a concordant or discordant alignment for a pair, it then tries to find alignments for the individual mates. This option disables that behavior.\nNo discordant alignments (–no-discordant) — by default, bowtie2 looks for discordant alignments if it cannot find any concordant alignments. A discordant alignment is an alignment where both mates align uniquely, but that does not satisfy the paired-end constraints. This option disables that behavior.\nNo forward orientation (–nofw) — if --nofw is specified, bowtie2 will not attempt to align unpaired reads to the forward (Watson) reference strand.\nNo reverse-complement orientation (–norc) — if --norc is specified, bowtie2 will not attempt to align unpaired reads against the reverse-complement (Crick) reference strand.\nNo overlapping mates (–no-overlap) — if one mate alignment overlaps the other at all, consider that to be non-concordant.\nNo mates containing one another (–no-contain) — if one mate alignment contains the other, consider that to be non-concordant.\nSelect the required parameters and press the Start button.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Bowtie 2 Aligning Short Reads When you select the Tools ‣ Align to …","ref":"/extensions/bowtie-2/bowtie-2-aligning-short-reads/","tags":"","title":"Bowtie 2 Aligning Short Reads"},{"body":"Bowtie Aligning Short Reads When you select the Tools ‣ DNA Assembly ‣ Align short reads item in the main menu, the Align Short Reads dialog appears. Set value of the Align short reads method parameter to Bowtie. The dialog looks as follows:\nThere are the following parameters:\nReference sequence — DNA sequence to align short reads to. This parameter is required.\nResult file name — file in SAM format to write the result of the alignment into.

Also you can build it manually.\nSAM output — always save the output file in the SAM format (the option is disabled for Bowtie).\nShort reads — each added short read is a small DNA sequence file. At least one read should be added.\nShort reads length for Bowtie can’t be more than 1024.\nYou can also configure other parameters. They are the same as in the original Bowtie (you can read detailed description of the parameters on the Bowtie manual page).\nSelect one of the following alignment modes:\nThe -n alignment mode:\nWhen the -n mode is selected, Bowtie determines which alignments are valid according to the following policy. Alignments may have no more than N mismatches (where N is a number 0-3) in the first L bases (where L is a number 5 or greater, set with Seed length) on the high-quality (left) end of the read. The sum of the Phred quality values at all mismatched positions (not just in the seed) may not exceed E (set with Maq error). Where qualities are unavailable (e.g. if the reads are from a FASTA file), the Phred quality defaults to 40.\nThe -v alignment mode:\nIn -v mode, alignments may have no more than V mismatches, where V may be a number from 0 through 3. Quality values are ignored. The -v mode is mutually exclusive with the -n mode.\nThe following parameters are available:\nMaq error (–maqerr) — maximum permitted total of quality values at all mismatched read positions throughout the entire alignment, not just in the “seed”. The default is 70. By default, Bowtie rounds quality values to the nearest 10 and saturates at 30. Note that the rounding can be disabled with No Maq rounding.\nSeed Length (–seedlen) — the number of bases on the high-quality end of the read to which the -n applies. The lowest permitted setting is 5 and the default is 28.\nMaximum of backtracks (-maxbts) — the maximum number of backtracks (default: 125 without Best, 800 with Best). A “backtrack” is the introduction of a speculative substitution into the alignment.\nDescriptors memory usage (–chunkmbs) — the number of megabytes of memory a given thread is given to store path descriptors in the Best flag. Default: 64. This parameter is available if the Best flag is checked.\nSeed (–seed) — pseudo-random number generator.\nThe following flags are available:\nNo Maq rounding (–nomaqround) — Maq (Mapping and Assembly with Quality) accepts quality values in the Phred quality scale, but internally rounds values to the nearest 10, with a maximum of 30. By default, Bowtie also rounds this way. No Maq rounding prevents this rounding in Bowtie.\nNo forward orientation (–nofw) — do not attempt to align against the forward reference strand.\nNo reverse-complement orientation (–norc) — do not attempt to align against the reverse-complement reference strand.\nTry as hard (–tryhard) — try as hard as possible to find valid alignments when they exist, including paired-end alignments.\nBest alignments (–best) — make Bowtie guarantee that reported singleton alignments are “best” in terms of stratum (i.e. number of mismatches, or mismatches in the seed for the case of -n mode) and in terms of the quality values at the mismatched position(s).\nAll alignments (–all) — report all valid alignments per read or pair. Validity of alignments is determined by the alignment policy (combined effects of -n mode, -v mode, Seed length, and Maq error).\nSelect the required parameters and press the Start button.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Bowtie Aligning Short Reads When you select the Tools ‣ DNA Assembly ‣ …","ref":"/extensions/bowtie/bowtie-aligning-short-reads/","tags":"","title":"Bowtie Aligning Short Reads"},{"body":"Browsing and Zooming Assembly Opening Assembly Browser Window Assembly Browser Window Assembly Browser Window Components Reads Area Description Assembly Overview Description Ruler and Coverage Graph Description Go to Position in Assembly Using Bookmarks for Navigation in Assembly Data ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Browsing and Zooming Assembly Opening Assembly Browser Window Assembly …","ref":"/assembly-browser/browsing-and-zooming-assembly/","tags":"","title":"Browsing and Zooming Assembly"},{"body":"Build Frequency Matrix Element Builds a frequency matrix.

The specified value should be more than 15. The difference score of an overlap is the sum of scores at each difference.\nMax qscore sum at differences (-d) — remove an overlap if its difference score is greater than the specified value. The specified value should be more than 20.\nSimilarity score of an overlap parameters:\nThe following parameters are used to calculate the similarity score of an overlapping alignment:\nMatch score factor (-m) — a match at bases of quality values q1 and q2 is given a score of m * min(q1, q2), where m is the specified value. The specified value should be more than 0.\nMismatch score factor (-n) — a mismatch at bases of quality values q1 and q2 is given a score of n * min(q1, q2), where n is the specified value. The specified value should be less than 0.\nGap penalty factor (-g) — a base of quality value q1 in a gap is given a score -g * min(q1, q2), where g is the specified value; q2 is the quality value of the base in the other sequence right before the gap. The specified value should be more than 0.\nThe similarity score is caclulated as the sum of scores of each match, each mismatch and each gap.

The specified value should be more than 250.\nLength and percent identity of an overlap parameters:\nOverlap length cutoff (-o) — minimum length of an overlap (in base pairs). The specified value should be more than 15 base pairs.\nOverlap percent identity cutoff (-p) — minimum percent identity of an overlap. The specified value should be more than 65%.\nOther parameters:\nMaximum number of word matches (-t) — an upper limit of word matches between a read and other reads. Increasing the value would result in more accuracy, however this could slow down the program. The specified value should be more than 0.\nBand expansion size (-a) — a number of bases to expand a band of diagonals for an overlapping alignment between two sequence reads. The specified value should be more than 10.\nMax gap length in any overlap (-f) — reject overlaps with a gap longer than the specified value. A small value may cause the program to remove true overlaps and to produce incorrect results. This option may be used by the user to split reads from alternative splicing forms into separate contigs.

As with SMART, families describing very short motifs or peptides may be missing from the mirror. An HMM-based search engine is offered on the Pfam site. SMART - a mirror of a recent SMART set of domain alignments. Note that some SMART families may be missing from the mirror due to update delays or because they describe very short conserved peptides and/or motifs, which would be difficult to detect using the CD-Search service. You may want to try the HMM-based search service offered on the SMART site. Note also that some SMART domains are not mirrored in CD because they represent “superfamilies” encompassing several individual, but related, domains; the corresponding seed alignments may not be available from the source database in these cases.

TIGRFAM - a mirror of a recent TIGRFAM set of domain alignments. An HMM-based search engine is offered on the TIGRFAM site. COG - a mirror of the current COG database of orthologous protein families focusing on prokaryotes. Seed alignments have been generated by an automated process. An alternative search engine, “Cognitor”, which runs protein-BLAST against a database of COG-assigned sequences, is offered on the COG site. KOG - a eukaryotic counterpart to the COG database.

Cistrome Tools was removed in UGENE 42.0 version.\nThe component for ChIP-seq data analysis is not installed by default. To use this sample, add the component via the UGENE Online Installer or, if you used an offline installer, manually configure the package, see “Configure ChIP-seq Analysis Data” chapter of the manual. This manual availavle until UGENE 39.version.\nto check which genes are nearby so can be regarded as potential regulated genes, then perform GO analysis;The ChIP-seq pipeline “Cistrome” integrated into UGENE allows one to do the following analysis steps: peak calling and annotating, motif search and gene ontology. ChIP-seq analysis is started from MACS tool. CEAS then takes peak regions and signal wiggle file to check which chromosome is enriched with binding/modification sites, whether bindings events are significant at gene features like promoters, gene bodies, exons, introns or UTRs, and the signal aggregation at gene transcription start/end sites or meta-gene bodies (average all genes). Then peaks are investigated in these ways:\nto check the conservation scores at the binding sites; the DNA motifs at binding sites. Note that it is originally based on the General ChIP-seq pipeline from the public Cistrome installation on the Galaxy workflow platform.\nHow to Use This Sample\nIf you haven’t used the workflow samples in UGENE before, look at the “How to Use Sample Workflows” section of the documentation.\nWorkflow Sample Location The workflow sample “ChIP-seq Analysis with Cistrome Tools” can be found in the “NGS” section of the Workflow Designer samples.\nWorkflow Image For treatment tags only analysis type the workflow looks as follows:\nFor treatment and control tags analysis type the workflow looks as follows:\nWorkflow Wizard The wizards are the same for both types of workflows. The wizard has 7 pages.\nInput data: Here you need to input a file with treatment and control annotations for MACS.\nMACS: Here you can change default MACS parameters.\nThe following parameters are available:\nGenome size (Mbp)\nHomo sapience - 2700 Mbp\nMus musculus - 1870 Mbp\nCaenorhabditis elegans - 90 Mbp\nDrosophila melanogaster - 120 Mbp\nIt’s the mappable genome size or effective genome size which is defined as the genome size which can be sequenced. Because of the repetitive features on the chromosomes, the actual mappable genome size will be smaller than the original size, about 90% or 70% of the genome size.\nP-value\nP-value cutoff. Default is 0.00001, for looser results, try 0.001 instead.\nTag size (optional)\nLength of reads. Determined from first 10 reads if not specified (input 0).\nKeep duplicates\nIt controls the MACS behavior towards duplicate tags at the exact same location – the same coordination and the same strand. The default auto option makes MACS calculate the maximum tags at the exact same location based on binomal distribution using 1e-5 as pvalue cutoff; and the all option keeps every tags. If an integer is given, at most this number of tags will be kept at the same location.\nUse model\nWhether or not to use MACS paired peaks model.\nModel fold\nSelect the regions within MFOLD range of high-confidence enrichment ratio against. Model fold is available when Use Model is true, which is the foldchange to chose paired peaks to build paired peaks model. Users need to set a lower(smaller) and upper(larger) number for fold change so that MACS will only use the peaks within these foldchange range to build model.\nWiggle output\nIf this flag is on, MACS will store the fragment pileup in wiggle format for the whole genome data instead of for every chromosomes.\nWiggle space\nBy default, the resolution for saving wiggle files is 10 bps, i.e., MACS will save the raw tag count every 10 bps. You can change it along with Wiggle output parameter.\nShift size\nAn arbitrary shift value used as a half of the fragment size when model is not built. Shift size is available when Use Model is false, which will represent the HALF of the fragment size of your sample. If your sonication and size selection size is 300 bps, after you trim out nearly 100 bps adapters, the fragment size is about 200 bps, so you can specify 100 here.\nBand width\nThe band width which is used to scan the genome for model building. You can set this parameter as the sonication fragment size expected from wet experiment. Used only while building the shifting model.\nUse lambda\nWhether to use local lambda model which can use the local bias at peak regions to throw out false positives.\nSmall nearby region\nThe small nearby region in basepairs to calculate dynamic lambda. This is used to capture the bias near the peak summit region. Invalid if there is no control data.\nAuto bimodal\nWhether turn on the auto pair model process.If set, when MACS failed to build paired model, it will use the nomodelsettings, the Shift size parameter to shift and extend each tags.\nScale to large\nWhen set, scale the small sample up to the bigger sample.By default, the bigger dataset will be scaled down towards the smaller dataset,which will lead to smaller p/qvalues and more specific results. Keep in mind that scaling down will bring down background noise more.\nCEAS: The next page allows to configure CEAS parameters.\nThe following parameters are available:\nGene annotations table\nPath to gene annotation table (e.g. a refGene table in sqlite3 db format.\nSpan size\nSpan from TSS and TTS in the gene-centered annotation (base pairs). ChIP regions within this range from TSS and TTS are considered when calculating the coverage rates in promoter and downstream.\nWiggle profiling resolution\nWiggle profiling resolution. WARNING: Value smaller than the wig interval (resolution) may cause aliasing error.\nPromoter/downstream interval\nPromoter/downstream intervals for ChIP region annotation are three values or a single value can be given. If a single value is given, it will be segmented into three equal fractions (e.g. 3000 is equivalent to 1000,2000,3000).\nBiPromoter ranges\nBidirectional-promoter sizes for ChIP region annotation. It’s two values or a single value can be given. If a single value is given, it will be segmented into two equal fractions (e.g. 5000 is equivalent to 2500,5000).\nRelative distance\nRelative distance to TSS/TTS in WIGGLE file profiling.\nGene group files\nGene groups of particular interest in wig profiling. Each gene group file must have gene names in the 1st column. The file names are separated by commas.\nGene group names\nSet this parameter empty for using default values.\nThe names of the gene groups from “Gene group files” parameter. These names appear in the legends of the wig profiling plots.\nValues range: comma-separated list of strings. Default value: ‘Group 1, Group 2,…Group n’.\nPeak2Gene and Gene Ontology: The next page allows to configure Peak2Gene and Gene Ontology parameters.\nThe following parameters are available:\nOutput type\nThe directory to store Conduct GO results.\nOfficial gene symbols\nOutput official gene symbol instead of refseq name.\nDistance\nSet a number which unit is base. It will get the refGenes in n bases from peak center.\nGenome file\nSelect a genome file (sqlite3 file) to search refGenes.\nTitle\nTitle is used to name the output files - so make it meaningful.\nGene Universe\nSelect a gene universe.\nConservation plot: On this page you can modify Conservation Plot parameters.\nThe following parameters are available:\nTitle\nTitle of the figure.\nLabel\nLabel of data in the figure.\nAssembly version\nThe directory to store phastcons scores.\nWindow width\nWindow width centered at middle of regions.\nHeight\nHeight of plot.\nWidth\nWidth of plot.\nSeqPos motif tool: On this page you can modify SeqPos motif parameters.\nThe following parameters are available:\nGenome assembly version\nUCSC database version.\nDe novo motifs\nRun de novo motif search.\nMotif database\nKnown motif collections.\nRegion width\nWidth of the region to be scanned for motifs; depends on a resolution of assay.\nPvalue cutoff\nPvalue cutoff for the motif significance.\nOutput data: On this page you can modify output parameters.\nThe following parameters are available.\nMACS output:\nOutput directory\nDirectory to save MACS output files.\nName\nName string of the experiment. MACS will use this string NAME to create output files like ‘NAME_peaks.xls’, ‘NAME_negative_peaks.xls’, ‘NAME_peaks.bed’, ‘NAME_summits.bed’, ‘NAME_model.r’ and so on. So please avoid any confliction between these filenames and your existing files.\nCEAS output:\nOutput report file\nPath to the report output file. Result for the CEAS analysis.\nOutput annotations file\nName of tab-delimited output text file, containing a row of annotations for every RefSeq gene. Note that the file is not generated if there is no peak regions input.\nConservation Plot output:\nOutput file\nFile to store phastcons results (BMP).\nSeqPos motif tool output:\nOutput directory\nDirectory to store seqpos results.\nOutput file name\nName of the output file which stores new motifs found during a de novo search.\nPeak2Gene output:\nGene annotations\nLocation of peak2gene gene annotations data file.\nPeak annotations\nLocation of peak2gene peak annotations data file.\nConduct GO output:\nOutput directory\nDirectory to store Conduct GO results.\nThe work on this pipeline was supported by grant RUB1-31097-NO-12 from NIAID.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"ChIP-seq Analysis with Cistrome Tools Attention!

The Align with ClustalW dialog appears (see below), where you can adjust the following parameters:\nGap opening penalty — cost of opening up a new gap in the alignment. Increasing this value will make gaps less frequent.\nGap extension penalty — cost of every item in a gap. Increasing this value will make gaps shorter.\nWeight matrix — specifies a single weight matrix for nucleotide sequences or series of matrices for protein sequences.\nFor nucleotide sequences the weight matrix selected defines the scores assigned to matches and mismatches (including IUB ambiguity codes), it can take values:\nIUB — default scoring matrix used by BESTFIT for the comparison of nucleic acid sequences. X’s and N’s are treated as matches to any IUB ambiguity symbol. All matches score 1.9; all mismatches for IUB symbols score 0. CLUSTALW — previous system used by ClustalW, in which matches score 1.0 and mismatches score 0. All matches for IUB symbols also score 0. For protein sequences it describes the similarity of each amino acid to each other. The following values are available:\nBLOSUM — BLOcks of Amino Acid SUbstitution Matrices first introduced in a paper by Henikoff and Henikoff. These matrices appear to be the best available for carrying out data base similarity (homology searches). PAM — Point Accepted Mutation matrices introduced by Margaret Dayhoff. These have been extremely widely used since the late ‘70s. GONNET — these matrices were derived using almost the same procedure as the Dayhoff one (above) but are much more up to date and are based on a far larger data set. They appear to be more sensitive than the Dayhoff series. ID — identity matrix which gives a score of 1.0 to two identical amino acids and a score of zero otherwise. Iteration type — specifies the iteration type to use. During the iteration step each sequence is removed in turn and realigned. It is kept if the resulting alignment is better than the one has been made before. This process is repeated until the score converges or until the maximum number of iterations is reached. Available values are:\nNONE — specifies not to use iterations. TREE — specifies to iterate at each step of the progressive alignment. ALIGNMENT — specifies to iterate on the final alignment. Max iterations — maximum number of iterations.\nThe following parameters are only available for protein sequences:\nGap separation distance — tries to decrease the chances of gaps being too close to each other. Gaps that are less than this distance apart are penalized more than other gaps. This does not prevent close gaps; it makes them less frequent, promoting a block-like appearance of the alignment.\nHydrophilic gaps off — increases the chances of a gap within a run of hydrophilic amino acids.\nNo end gap separation penalty — treats end gaps just like internal gaps to avoid gaps that are too close.\nResidue-specific gaps off — amino acid specific gap penalties that reduce or increase the gap opening penalties at each position in the alignment or sequence. For example, positions that are rich in glycine are more likely to have an adjacent gap than positions that are rich in valine.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"ClustalW Clustal is a widely used multiple sequence alignment program. …","ref":"/extensions/clustalw/","tags":"","title":"ClustalW"},{"body":"Collapsing and Expanding Branches You can hide branches of a clade by selecting the Collapse item in the context menu of the clade’s root node or use the Collapse button on the tree toolbar:\nTo show the collapsed clade select the Expand item in the node’s context menu.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Collapsing and Expanding Branches You can hide branches of a clade by …","ref":"/phylogenetic-tree-viewer/working-with-clade/collapsing-and-expanding-branches/","tags":"","title":"Collapsing and Expanding Branches"},{"body":"Collapsing Rows It is able to collapse the sequential rows.

Thus, the colors may vary in this case from the described below.\nColoring Schemes for Nucleotides The following schemes options are available for a nucleotide alignment:\nNo colors — do not color the residues background (i. e. all residues have a white background and black font).\nJalview — use the following background colors: A - green, C - orange, G - red, T/U - blue. Gaps and characters of the extended nucleotide alphabet are not colored.\nPercentage identity — a residue background color depends on its presence in the column of the alignment: \u003c=40% - white, 41-60% - light slate blue, 61-80% - medium slate blue, 81-100% dark slate blue.\nPercentage identity (colored) — colors depend on the residues percentage presence in a column. The following rules are applied (in the order of priority):\nIf all residues (100%) are the same and there are no gaps, the residues in the column have a yellow background and red font. If there are 50% of one residue in the column and 50% of another (gaps are not taken into account), one-half of the residues has a green background and black font (the half to be colored is determined based on the following priorities: T\u003eU\u003eG\u003eC\u003eA\u003eB\u003eD\u003eH\u003eK\u003eM\u003eR\u003eS\u003eV\u003eW\u003eY\u003eN). If there is one or several residues in a column with a percentage number more or equal to the threshold parameter (see the Threshold parameter on the Highlighting tab of the Options Panel), then most frequent residues are colored as follows: light blue background color and blue font. Note that gaps are taken into account when calculating the percentage number in the column in this case. Also, if required, the same residues priorities are applied as in the previous rule. If the rules above are not applied for a residue, then it remains uncolored, i.e. white background color and black font are used. Percentage identity (gray) — this coloring scheme is similar to the Percentage identity scheme, but shades of gray color are used instead of the slate blue color.\nUGENE — this is the default coloring scheme, the following background colors are used: A - yellow, C - light green, G - light blue, T/U - light red, gap - white. Other colors may are used for characters of the extended nucleotide alphabet.\nUGENE Sanger — this coloring scheme is used in the UGENE Sanger Reads Editor, the background colors correspond to the peaks of Sanger chromatogram peaks: A - green, C - blue, G - light gray, T - red. The orange background color is used for a gap, the magenta background color is used for characters of the extended nucleotide alphabet.\nWeak Similarities — when there is a choice between two characters and it is not specified by other rules which character to color, following priorities: T\u003eU\u003eG\u003eC\u003eA\u003eB\u003eD\u003eH\u003eK\u003eM\u003eR\u003eS\u003eV\u003eW\u003eY\u003eN.\nColoring rules:\nDo not color gaps (“-“), i.e. use a black font and white background. Residues should be colored according to their percentage number in the column (use the priorities, described above, in case of equal percentage numbers). Residues with the most frequency/priority in the column. A custom scheme can be created and used with colors that depend on a residue.\nColoring Schemes for Amino Acids The following schemes options are available for an amino acids alignment:\nNo colors — do not color the residues background (i. e. all residues have a white background and black font).\nBuried index — depending on the frequency of occurrence inside a globule the amino acid residues are colored from light green (less frequent) to blue (most frequent).\nClustal X — an emulation of the default color scheme in Clustal X, a graphical interface for the ClustalW multiple alignment programs.\nHelix propensity — depending on helix propensity the residues are colored from magenta (the highest helix propensity) to green (the lowest one).\nHydrophobicity — residues are colored based on their hydrophobicity. Most hydrophobic residues are red, most hydrophilic are blue.\nPercentage identity — a residue background color depends on its presence in the column of the alignment: \u003c=40% - white, 41-60% - light slate blue, 61-80% - medium slate blue, 81-100% dark slate blue.\nPercentage i__dentity (gray) — this coloring scheme is similar to the Percentage identity scheme, but shades of gray color are used instead of the slate blue color.\nStrand propensity — residues with the highest strand propensity are yellow, with the lowest are blue.\nTailor — see this publication by William R.Taylor.\nTurn propensity — residues with the highest turn propensity are red, with lowest are cyan.\nUGENE — this is the default coloring scheme, the following background colors are used for the residues: positive (KRH) - yellow, aromatic (FWY) - green, large alphatic hydrophobic (ILM) - blue, small hydrophobic (ST) - rose, GP - red, EX - gray.\nZappo — amino acids residues are colored according to their physicochemical properties: alphatic/hydrophobic (residues ILVAM) - rose, aromatic (FWY) - orange, positive (KRH) - dark blue, negative (DE) - red, hydrophilic (STNQ) - light green, conformationally special (PG) - magenta, cysteine (C) - yellow.\nA custom scheme can be created and used with colors that depend on a character.\nCreating Custom Color Scheme\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Coloring Schemes It is possible to apply different coloring schemes …","ref":"/alignment-editor/overview/coloring-schemes/","tags":"","title":"Coloring Schemes"},{"body":"Common Function printToLog (parameter) - prints the results to the Log View.

There are different methods to calculate the consensus. Each method reveals unique biological properties of the aligned sequences. The Alignment Editor allows switching between different consensus modes. To switch the consensus mode go to the General tab of the Options Panel or activate the context menu (using the right mouse button) or the Actions menu and select the Consensus mode item and General tab will be opened automatically:\nThere are several consensus modes:\nDefault — the mode is based on the JalView algorithm. A character in the consensus is calculated based on the characters in the corresponding column and the value of the threshold: If the percentage value of a most frequent character is greater than the threshold, the character is shown in upper case in the consensus. If there are two characters with the equal highest frequency in a column, the ‘+\" sign is shown. If the percentage value of a most frequent character is high, but lower than the specified threshold, the character is shown in lower case in the consensus. ClustalW — emulates the ClustalW program behavior. If the percentage value of a most frequent character is equal to 100%, the * base is shown in the consensus. Otherwise, no characters are shown. Levitsky (not for AMINO alignment) — proposed by Victor Levitsky, this mode calculates the consensus of a DNA alignment, taking into account frequencies of characters in the whole alignment, i.e. not only one column. The algorithm includes these steps: Collect global alignment frequencies for every character in alignment using the extended DNA alphabet. For example: The A base increments the counter of the following bases: A (the base itself), W (A or T), R (A or G), M (A or C), V (A or C or G), H (A or C or T), D (A or G or T), N (A or C or G or T). Check the frequency of each symbol in the column: If the frequency percentage value is is greater than the threshold, this base is considerer as a cosequence symbol - see further algorithm description. If the frequency percentage value is lower than the specified threshold, this base is not considered as a cosequence symbol. from the set of bases, not filered on the point 2, choose the rarest characters in the whole alignment (global frequencies have been calulated on the point 1): If there is only one base, this character is shown in the consensus. If there are two or more bases, these symbols should be joint into one common base. For example, if there are two bases A and T, they will be joint into an extened DNA alphabet base W. Check this table to find out all possible combinations. Simple extended (not for AMINO alignment) — a character of the consensus is calculated based on the characters in the corresponding column. This algorithm joints all bases in the column (but only the ones which frequency percentage value is greater than the threshold) into a single base from the DNA extended alphabet using using this table. Strict — if a character percentage in a column is higher than the specified threshold, the character is shown in the consensus at this position. Otherwise, a gap character (‘—’) is shown. Also the General tab shows the general information about an alignment and allows one to set up a reference sequence.

It can be used by advanced UGENE users for providing a tool for their colleagues.\nBelow the preparatory configuration steps for the second option are described.\nCreate an XML configuration file for custom external tool Create an XML file with the custom external tool description. The file should match the following XML schema:\n\u003c?xml version = \"1.0\" encoding = \"UTF-8\"?\u003e \u003cxs:schema xmlns:xs = “http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\u003e\n\u003cxs:element name = “ugeneExternalToolConfig”\u003e xs:complexType xs:sequence \u003cxs:element name = “name” type = “xs:string” /\u003e \u003cxs:element name = “id” type = “xs:string” /\u003e \u003cxs:element name = “executableName” type = “xs:string” /\u003e \u003cxs:element name = “executableFullPath” type = “xs:string” minOccurs =“0” /\u003e \u003cxs:element name = “description” type = “xs:string” minOccurs =“0” /\u003e \u003cxs:element name = “version” type = “xs:string” minOccurs =“0” /\u003e \u003cxs:element name = “launcherId” type = “xs:string” minOccurs =“0” /\u003e \u003cxs:element name = “dependencies” type = “xs:string” minOccurs =“0” /\u003e \u003c/xs:sequence\u003e \u003cxs:attribute name = “version” type = “xs:string” use=“required” /\u003e \u003c/xs:complexType\u003e \u003c/xs:element\u003e\n\u003c/xs:schema\u003e\nThere XML elements have the following meaning:\nname - the external tool name as it should be displayed in the UGENE GUI. This XML element is mandatory.\nid - the external tool unique identifier. The following characters are allowed: letters (‘A’-‘Z’), digits (‘0’-‘9), ‘_’, ‘-’. This XML element is mandatory.\nexecutableName - the name of the tool executable file (with the file extension, if it is present). This XML element is mandatory.\nexecutableFullPath - a full path to the external tool executable. This XML element is optional. If the “executableFullPath” value is not specified, UGENE searches for a file with the specified “executableName” name in the same folder as the XML config file and sets the tool path accordingly. One can also specify either an absolute path to a file or a path, relative to the XML config. The path is displayed near the tool in the “Application Settings” dialog. It can be also manually set up by a user.\ndescription - a detailed description of the external tool. This XML element is optional.\nversion - a version of the tool executable. This XML element is optional.\nlauncherId - if the tool is supposed to be run with some script interpreter or it is a java application, then this element should contain an appropriate ID. Currently, UGENE supports the following launchers IDs: USUPP_PYTHON2, USUPP_PERL, USUPP_RSCRIPT, USUPP_JAVA. If the launcher is specified, it would be added to the launch command explicitly whenever you try to launch the external tool. The path to the launcher will be taken from the “Application Settings” (see the corresponding tools in the “Supported tools” group). If the element is not specified or it is empty, no additional launcher will be added to the command that will run the tool. This XML element is optional.\ndependencies - a comma-separated list of other external tool IDs the new tool is dependent from. If the dependency is not satisfied, then the dependent tool is marked as “not valid” in UGENE. This XML element is optional.\nSee also the following examples:\nA minimalistic config:\n\u003c?xml version = \"1.0\" encoding = \"UTF-8\"?\u003e An imported custom tool CUSTOM\\_TOOL my\\_tool.py This config describes only the tool name, the tool ID and the tool executable file path. If the XML config is imported from the same folder as the python script, the path will be set to the python script. The tool won’t have any dependencies, its version will be “unknown”.\nA config without dependencies and a launcher:\n\u003c?xml version = \"1.0\" encoding = \"UTF-8\"?\u003e RAxML RAXML raxmlHPC ./my\\_folder/raxmlHPC RAxML - Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood 8.2.12 This config describes an external tool with a description and a version. Path to the tool executable is relative: it is supposed that the folder structure is the following:\nmy_config.xml my_folder/ raxmlHPC\nA config with a dependency and a launcher:\n\u003c?xml version = \"1.0\" encoding = \"UTF-8\"?\u003e HISAT2 HISAT2 hisat2 d:\\\\work\\\\hisat2.1\\\\hisat2 HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads (both DNA and RNA) to a population of human genomes (as well as to a single reference genome). HISAT2 2.1.0 UGENE\\_PERL UGENE\\_PERL This config describes a tool that is supposed to be run by the Perl interpreter. There is no Perl by default on Windows, but the UGENE installer provides a possibility to install Perl. The tool can notify UGENE that it should be launched by Perl, so UGENE will add a path to Perl to the command that runs the tool. The XML config also specifies an absolute full path to the executable file.\nPrepare a package with the XML configuration file, the tool executable and, optionally, other files The easiest way to “pack” the custom external tool is to:\ncreate a new folder with all files required for running the tool, specify a relative path in the XML configuration file described above, put the XML configuration file into the same folder as the main tool executable. This “package” can be shared with other users, if required.\nImport the tool into UGENE To add the custom external tool one needs to import its XML configuration file in the “Custom tools” group on the “External Tools” page of the “Application Settings” dialog.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Custom External Tools A custom tool can be integrated into the UGENE …","ref":"/basic-functions/ugene-application-settings/external-tools/custom-external-tools/","tags":"","title":"Custom External Tools"},{"body":"Cut Adapter Element Removes adapter sequences.\nElement type: CutAdaptFastq\nParameters\nParameter\nDescription\nDefault value\nParameter in Workflow File\nType\nOutput directory\nSelect an output directory.

The following options are available:\nILLUMINACLIP: Cutadapterandotherillumina-specific sequences from the read. SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality. TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality. CROP: Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length. AVGQUAL: Drop the read if the average quality is below the specified level. TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64. Each step has the own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases regardless of quality from the end of thread, so that the readhas maximally the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step is used to find and remove Illumina adapters.\nTrimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match enough, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines) and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are now available by default. The naming of the various sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections which will still allow a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12 base sequence will score just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore the threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases) Trimmomatic is still able to identify very, very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog. To call the dialog press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length which is likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases, however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favours read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to an average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base (i.e. the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used removing the special Illumina \" low-quality segment\" regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. To remove a step use the Remove selected step button.

The following options are available:\nILLUMINACLIP: Cutadapterandotherillumina-specific sequences from the read. SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality. TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality. CROP: Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length. AVGQUAL: Drop the read if the average quality is below the specified level. TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64. Each step has the own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases regardless of quality from the end of thread, so that the readhas maximally the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step is used to find and remove Illumina adapters.\nTrimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match enough, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines) and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are now available by default. The naming of the various sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections which will still allow a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12 base sequence will score just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore the threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases) Trimmomatic is still able to identify very, very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog. To call the dialog press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length which is likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases, however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favours read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to an average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base (i.e. the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used removing the special Illumina \" low-quality segment\" regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base.

It means that the consensus will only contain characters that are the same in ALL sequences of the alignment. Decreasing the threshold will result in taking into account only the specified percentage number of the sequences, i.e. if the threshold is “80%” and 82% of the sequences have “A” at a certain column position, the consensus will also contain “A” at this position.\nAlso, you may select another algorithm to calculate the consensus. The algorithm, proposed by Victor Levitsky, uses the extended DNA alphabet. The greater the “threshold” value selected for this algorithm, the more rare characters are taken into account. The specified value must be between 50% and 100%.\nFinally, there is “Keep gaps” parameter that specifies whether the result sequence must contain gaps, or they must be skipped. By default, the gaps are kept in the result consensus sequence.\nHow to Use This Sample\nIf you haven’t used the workflow samples in UGENE before, look at the “How to Use Sample Workflows” section of the documentation.\nWorkflow Sample Location The workflow sample “Extract Consensus as Sequence” can be found in the “Alignment” section of the Workflow Designer samples.\nWorkflow Image The workflow looks as follows:\nWorkflow Wizard The wizard has 3 pages.\nInput Multiple Alignments: On this page you must input multiple alignments file(s).\nExtracting Consensus Settings: On this page you can modify extracting settings.\nThe following parameters are available:\nAlgorithm\nThe algorithm of consensus extracting.\nThreshold\nThe threshold of the algorithm.\nKeep gaps\nSet this parameter if the result consensus must keep the gaps.\nOutput Files: For each input alignment the workflow outputs separate sequence file with consensus in it.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Extract Consensus as Sequence For each input multiple alignment the …","ref":"/workflow-designer/workflow-samples/alignment/extract-consensus-as-sequence/","tags":"","title":"Extract Consensus as Sequence"},{"body":"Extract Consensus as Text For each input multiple alignment the workflow calculates the consensus and saves it to a text file, named according to the name of the input alignment.\nThe JalView algorithm (denoted as “default”) is used by default to calculate the consensus. For each column of the alignment it returns either “+”, if there are 2 characters with high frequency in this column, or a character in uppercase or lowercase. The case of the character depends on the percentage value of the character in the column and the “threshold” value.\nAlternatively, you can use the ClustalW algorithm to calculate the consensus:\nIf all characters in a column are exactly the same, the algorithm sets asterisk value (\"*\") to the corresponding position of the consensus. A colon value (\":\") indicates conservation between groups of strongly similar properties, i.e. the scoring value is greater than 0.5 in the Gonnet PAM 250 matrix (see documentation for details). If the scoring value is less than 0.5, the period (\".\") value is inserted. Otherwise, the algorithm inserts space (\" “).

There are two ways to open the Find Repeats dialog:\nBy clicking on the toolbar button: By selecting the Analyze ‣ Find annotated regions… context menu item:\nAlgorithm This tool has been designed to search for annotations that intersect (or completely overlap - it depends on the specified parameters) other, already existing annotations of a given sequence. Let’s look at the example:\nWe have a sequence with two annotations. Annotations have different lengths and do not intersect each other. The annotation 2 length is four times the annotation 1 length (41 vs. 11 bases).\nUsing this function, we can find an annotation that intersects both source annotations and captures their shares depending on their lengths. For example, lets find an intersection 25 bases long. We will have the following annotation:\nAs we can see, the intersection with the first annotation is two characters long, and the intersection with the second annotation is eight characters long. This result was chosen because the second annotation is four times the length of the first annotation.\nNOTE: A good candidate for this feature could be any file in Genbank format with a rich set of annotations. FASTA is not the best option, because this format does not store annotations.\nParameters The following parameters are avaliable:\nLeft window - annotations to search intersection regions for. Right window - the list of possible intersection regions. Region size - the length of the new intersection region. Result strand - select the DNA strand whose annotations will be considered in the search. If, for example, the “Complement” strand is selected, but all choosen annotations are on the direct strand, than nothing will be found. Annotation must fit into region - all annotations, choosen at the left window, must fit completely to the result annotation (completely - not just in a few characters). Save regions as annotations - store results to annotations. Clear results - clear the result table.

Additionally, it is possible to merge data from another slots associated with the specified one.\nElement type: grouper\nParameters To use the Grouper element connect the Grouper’s input port to the required workflow element. Select the Grouper element on the Scene and specify Group slot and Group operation parameters in the Parameters area in the Property Editor. To merge associated data, it is possible to create as many Output slot(s) as required (see details below).\nGroup slot The Group slot specifies a slot that is used to group the input data. The list of available values of the parameter depend on the slots of workflow elements which produce data in the workflow before the Grouper element. There is a special Unset value. When it is selected, only one group is created.\nGroup operation The Group operation specifies criteria to group data supplied to the Group slot. It can take the following values:\nBy value - input data are compared by value (a group is created for each unique value, it can contain one or several identical values) By identity - input data are compared by internal data ID (all values are unique) By name - input data are compared by their names By value group operation is available for group slots of types Sequence, Set of annotations, MSA, Plain text, Source URL. By identity and By name group operations are available for group slots of type Sequence only.\nOutput slots When data supplied to the Group slot are divided into different groups the associated data are also got into a group. The possible associated data depend on the workflow. For example, a Sequence Reader element contains slots Sequence and Set of annotations. These data are associated as annotations belong to a sequence. Another example of associated data are sequence markers created by the Sequence Marker element. The associated data, therefore, can be additionally handled (i.e. merged) by the Grouper_element. The action that can be performed on the associated data depends on their type. In any case to output handled associated data you need to create a new output slot in the_Grouper element. To create it click the Add button in the Grouper’s Parameters area. The following dialog appears:\nIn the dialog you should select a Source data slot (i.e. a slot with the associated data) and input a name of the new slot. Click the OK button. A new dialog appears that specifies how the associated data should be merged. The view of the dialog and the available merge actions for different types of the Source data slot are the following:\nFor a Set of annotations slot the New Annotations Action dialog appears: You can merge annotations into one annotation table and, optionally, filter duplicated annotations. Also, you can shift annotations. To do it, you need to create another output slot with type Sequence and Merge into one sequence option selected (see below). In other words you need to merge all sequences in a group into one sequence. In this case you select the corresponding sequence slot in the New Annotations Action dialog and each set of annotations in a group is shifted according to the corresponding sequence in the group. As the result you have one sequence and one set of annotations allocated on the whole sequence.\nFor Source URL and Plain text slots the New String Action dialog appears: Using this dialog you can merge strings into one string. Optionally, you can specify an additional strings separator.\nFor a Sequence slot the New Sequence Action dialog appears: You can either merge all sequences in a group into one sequence or create a multiple sequence alignment. In the first case you need to specify the Merged sequence name and you can select the number of unknown characters between the merged sequences. In the second case you need to specify the alignment name. To filter duplicated sequence check the corresponding check box.\nFor a MSA slot the New Alignment Action dialog appears: Input the alignment name in this dialog. To filter duplicated rows check the corresponding check box.\nTo edit a created slot, select it in the Parameters area of the Grouper element and click the Edit button. To remove the slot, select it and click the Remove button.\nInput/Output Ports The element has 1 input port that can take any incoming data.\nName in GUI: Input data flow\nName in workflow File: input-data\nThe element has 1 output port.\nName in GUI: Grouped output data flow\nName in workflow File: output-data\nSlots:\nSlot In GUI\nSlot in workflow File\nType\nGroup size\ngroup-size\nstring\nAlso the port has one default slot of the grouped data and it may also have one or several customized output slots (see above).\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Grouper Element The element groups data supplied to the specified slot …","ref":"/workflow-designer/workflow-elements/data-flow/grouper-element/","tags":"","title":"Grouper Element"},{"body":"Header The header consists of the following key string:\n#!UGENE_WORKFLOW\nAnd multiline description of the workflow:\n# Write here the description\nof your workflow.

HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP: Cutadapterandotherillumina-specific sequences from the read. LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality. MAXINFO: Perform an adaptive quality trim. MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length. SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64. TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality. Each step has the own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases regardless of quality from the end of thread, so that the read has maximally the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step is used to find and remove Illumina adapters.\nTrimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match enough, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines) and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are now available by default. The naming of the various sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections which will still allow a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12 base sequence will score just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore the threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases) Trimmomatic is still able to identify very, very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog. To call the dialog press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length which is likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases, however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favours read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to an average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base (i.e. the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used removing the special Illumina \" low-quality segment” regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base.

Mutations\nMutations are distinctions between sequences. On the graphic they are represented by gaps in diagonal lines. They interrupt matches.\nb. Insertions\nInsertions are parts of one sequence that are missed in the another, while the surrounding parts match. In other words, an insertion is a subsequence that was inserted into a sequence.\nGraphically, insertions are represented by gaps which lie only on one axis. A little shift towards the other axis indicates a mutation involved.\nc. Deletions\nA deletion is a subsequence that was deleted from a sequence.\nA deletion from sequence A found in sequence B can be considered as an insertion into sequence B and contained in sequence A.\n3. Inverted repeats\nThe Dotplot plugin allows to search for inverted repeats as well. Inverted repeats are shown contrary to the direct repeats.\nUse the Search direct repeats and Search inverted repeats options of the Dotplot parameters dialog to select which repeats to draw (the dialog is described here).\n4.

This parameter is required.\nResult file name — file in UGENE database format or SAM format (if the box SAM output check), to write the result of the alignment into. This parameter is required.\nPrebuilt index — check this box to use an index file instead of a reference sequence. Also you can build it manually.\nSAM output — checking this box allows one to save output files in the SAM format. The default format of output files is the UGENE database format (ugenedb).\nShort reads — each added short read is a small DNA sequence file. At least one read should be added.\nThe Map NGS Reads with UGENE Genome Aligner has no limitation on short reads length.\nCommon parameters:\nMismatches allowed — check this box to allow mismatches between the reference sequence and a short read. Select one of the following:\nMismatches number to set the number of mismatched nucleotides allowed. This parameter can take values: 1, 2 and 3. Percentage of mismatches to set the number of mismatches in percents. Note, that in this case the absolute number of mismatches can vary for different reads. This parameter can take values: 1 - 10 %. Align options:\nUse GPU-optimization — use an openCL-enabled GPU during the alignment (the corresponding hardware should be available on your computer). This option was available until v44. Align reverse complement reads — use both: a read and its reverse complement during the alignment. Use “best”-mode during the alignment — report only about best alignments (in terms of mismatches). Omit reads with qualities lower than — omit all reads with qualities lower than the specified value. Reads that have no qualities are not omited. Advanced parameters:\nMaximum memory for short reads — maximum memory usage for short reads. This parameter allows one to decrease the load on the computer on one side and to increase the computer speed of the task on the other side.\nTotal memory usage — shows the total memory usage. System memory size — shows the total system memory size. Index parameters:\nReference fragmentation — this parameter influences the number of parts the reference will be divided. It is better to make it bigger, but it influences the amount of memory used during the alignment.\nIndex memory usage size — shows the index memory usage. Directory for index files — temporary directory for saving index files. You can choose a temporary directory for saving index files for the reference that will be built during the alignment.

E.g. if -X 100 is specified and a paired-end alignment consists of two 20-bp alignments in the proper orientation with a 60-bp gap between them, that alignment is considered valid (as long as -I is also satisfied). A 61-bp gap would not be valid in that case. If trimming options -3 or -5 are also used, the -X constraint is applied with respect to the untrimmed mates, not the trimmed mates. Default: 250.\n800\nmaxbts\nnumeric\nBest hits\nThe number of megabytes of memory a given thread is given to store path descriptors in –best mode. Best-first search must keep track of many paths at once to ensure it is always extending the path with the lowest cumulative cost. Bowtie tries to minimize the memory impact of the descriptors, but they can still grow very large in some cases.

The following dialog appears:\nIt is required to input:\nReference sequence — a file with a single DNA sequence of any supported file format (e.g. FASTA or GenBank). This parameter is mandatory.\nReads — a set of files in *.ab1 or *.scf format with the Sanger sequencing data to be mapped to the reference sequence. It is required to add at least one read. A read orientation (forward or reverse) will be automatically detected during the mapping.\nDuring the mapping task execution, these data are processed as follows. First of all, to enhance the further mapping sensitivity, the low-quality ends of the reads are trimmed off. Then the reads are mapped using a UGENE original method that works in two steps: rough mapping of a read using BLAST+ and enhancement of the read alignment with the Smith-Waterman algorithm. After that the percentage similarity of the two sequences is calculated, that is the number of all edit operations (i.e., insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to transform a read sequence into the corresponding region of the reference sequence. Reads that have low similarity with the reference sequence are filtered out.\nOne can configure the following parameters of the mapping task\nTrimming quality threshold — all bases at the ends of the reads with quality lower than the specified value are trimmed. To skip the trimming, set this value to zero.\nMapping min similarity — all reads mapped to the reference with lower percentage similarity than the specified value are filtered out.\nRead name in result alignment — reads in the resulting alignment can be named either by names of the sequences in the input files or by the input files names. Set this value to “File name”, for example, if the sequences in the input *.ab1 files have the same name, this will help in distinguishing of the reads in the resulting alignment.\nThe resulting alignment is stored in a native UGENEDB format. One can set up the file location and name in the Result alignment field. Note that thereafter it is also possible to export data to standard alignment formats without chromatograms such as FASTA, ClustalW, etc.\nTo initiate the mapping task execution click the Map button in the dialog.

It may be thought of as a distance parameter. The distance between 2 base pairs, ri rj and ri’ rj’ may be defined as max{|i-i′|, |j-j′|}. If k-1 foldings have already been predicted by mfold, the _k_th folding must have at least W base pairs that are at least a distance W from any of the base pairs in the first k-1 foldings. A new folding is not added to the output list unless this criterion is fulfilled. As W increases, the number of predicted foldings decreases. A smaller value of this parameter will usually result in more computed foldings that may be quite similar to one another. A larger value will result in fewer foldings that are very different from one another.\nIf the parameter is set to the default value, then in the calculations the real value of W will be set according to the described algorithm, based on the length of the selected region of the input sequence (see the Default column).\nMax base pair distance\n∞\n[1,∞]\nMAXBP\nIf the maximum distance between paired bases parameter, MAXBP, is specified, then any base pair, ri rj, in a folding must satisfy j-i≤MAXBP for a linear sequence or min{j-i, len+i-j}≤MAXBP, for a circular sequence (len is the length of the selected region of the input sequence).\nThus small values of MAXBP ensure that only short range base pairs will be predicted. For example, in a sequence of 1000 nucleotides, setting MAXBP to 50 will force mfold to compute foldings involving only short range base pairs.\nThe default is MAXBP=∞, which means no constraint.\nDisplay settings Corresponds to the Extended settings section on the main tab.\nParameter\nUnit\nDefault\nLimits\nTool argument name\nDescription\nBase numbering frequency\n10 (len≤50) 20 (51≤len≤300) 50 (301≤len)\n[0,1000]\nLAB_FR\nEach image marks the number of the base (nucleotide) starting from the beginning 5’. The frequency with which this number will be displayed on an image depends on this parameter: if it is 0, then the number will not appear anywhere if it is equal to 1, then each base will have its own number if it is equal to 2, then each even base will have a number and so on.\nCompare images above with the same algorithm settings to see the difference.\nIf the parameter is set to the default value, then in the calculations the real value of LAB_FR will be set according to the described algorithm, based on the length of the selected region of the input sequence (see the Default column).\nRotation angle\n°\n0\n[-180,180]\nROT_ANG\nSpecifying the orientation of the folded molecule by selecting the rotation angle. Positive values correspond to counter-clockwise.\nRegion settings Specifies the part of the sequence that will be analyzed. The tool will only work with this piece of the sequence in isolation from the whole sequence.\nYou can select the entire sequence, a custom region, or a selected region if there was one. The region must be less than 3000 bases. It is acceptable to select a small region (\u003c10bp), but there will almost certainly be no folding there.\nIf several regions have been selected in a sequence (using the GenBank format), then the dialog will only accept the first of them. The remaining selected regions are ignored. But there is an exception: if the sequence is marked circular and the region passing through the end/beginning is selected, then such a region is considered as a whole region and mfold will be launched on it as on an ordinary piece of the sequence (2 parts of the region – one that goes to end and another that starts from the beginning of the sequence – will be combined into one sequence and analyzed). This is the only case where the start of a region can be greater than the end:\nA linear sequence is marked with the symbol and for it the region 70..50 is invalid. A circular sequence is marked with the symbol and for it the region 70..50 is valid. The length of the region in this case 70..50 depends on the sequence length.\nOutput settings UGENE\u0026Ghostscript settings in the “Output” tab.\nParameter\nDefault\nDescription\nSave output to\n/path/to/sequence/\nThe folder where the “mfold” subdirectory will be created with the output data in it. By default, this folder is the same as the folder where the input sequence is stored.\nFor example, let’s say our OS is Windows and the analyzed sequence has the path “C:\\path\\to\\sequence\\my_sequence.fa”. After running the task, the folder structure will look something like this\nC:. └───path └───to └───sequence │ my_sequence.fa │ └───mfold └───2024.03.19_16-31-34 inp.fa_1.pdf inp.fa_1.png inp.fa_2.pdf inp.fa_2.png inp.fa_3.pdf inp.fa_3.png out.html\nThe output folder must have write permissions.\nDPI\n96\nSetting up the Ghostscript converter from PS files to PNG. Quality of saved images (PNG files). The higher this parameter, the higher the quality, size and resolution of the resulting images.\nThis setting only affects images in the output folder. This setting does not affect images in the UGENE report. This setting does not affect PDF output files.\nFor more information about output types, see the Output data section.\nInternal parameters Settings that the user cannot explicitly influence.\nMolecule Type (DNA/RNA). mfold gets sequence information from command line arguments. Information about what type will be passed to the tool can be seen next to the sequence name Molecule Topology (linear/circular). mfold gets sequence information from command line arguments. If the sequence is marked as circular, then mfold will work with it as a circular one. Otherwise, as with linear one. Whether the sequence is linear/circular is described here. Part of a circular sequence will also be considered a circular sequence. If you want to change this behavior, uncheck “Mark sequence as circular” and then call the mfold dialog. DPI of images in UGENE. Ghostscript has a default DPI of 72. Therefore, this value is used for images for the internal UGENE report and this value cannot be changed. Saving/resetting dialog state Some dialog fields retain their state between dialog calls. For such fields, the ability to reset settings is also available (the “Reset settings” button at the bottom left in the screenshot of the dialog). Below is a table showing which states are saved between dialog calls and which of them can be reset to default values.\nSave states\nReset states\nAlgorithm settings\nyes (it can be tedious to enter fields every time)\nyes\nDisplay settings\nRegion\nno (since the region is optionally selected manually by the user)\nno (the same reason)\nOutput settings\nyes\nno (these unique settings are changed manually by the user when the user really needs it; a quick reset only makes sense for algorithmic settings)\nStates are saved only for a specific sequence window. Thus, if you have two windows (or two views) for sequence-1 and one window for sequence-2, then each window will have its own state for the mfold dialog.\nOutput data There are 3 types of output from the mfold task in UGENE:\nReport displayed inside UGENE. HTML report with images saved on disk. Temporary data (for advanced users). UGENE report Example of a report on Windows (appearance may vary slightly between systems):\nStatus, Time, … At the beginning there is information about the run: information about the task, settings for launch. Output HTML report. Clickable link to the output HTML report. More about this report in the next section. Found structures. List of found structures. The structure is characterized by free energy. When clicked, UGENE will scroll the window to the desired structure. Structure table. For each found structure, the table contains: Thermodynamic details: free energy, enthalpy, entropy and an estimated Tm. Loop Free-Energy Decomposition: the entire decomposition of the particular folding into loops and stacks, together with their free energies and closing base pairs. Consecutive runs of base pairs are summarized as helices. Image. Displays of nucleic acid secondary structure. At the bottom of the image there is information identifying it: free energy, name of the input sequence and analyzed region. It has the above-mentioned fixed DPI of 72. mfold log. Information about launching the external mfold tool: launch command and log. If no structure is found, mfold will fail with an error and display a corresponding message “No hairpins found. Nothing to show”. No new files will be created.\nSometimes the report may not contain the structure table. This happens because there are a lot of results/the resulting decomposition tables are too large. In this case, the result must be viewed in a browser (click on the “Output HTML report” link).\nHTML report A single HTML report and PNG+PDF for each structure found are saved in the output folder. The HTML report displays these images, PDFs and detailed information about the launch in an easy-to-view form. This version of the report also contains:\nLaunch information. List of found structures with links to them. Information about each structure. The Loop Free-Energy Decomposition is located under the “Show structure detailed info” arrow. The quality of the images in the report depends on the DPI setting in the dialog. When you click on the picture, a PDF file with a structure image opens in a new tab, identical to the picture image, but allows you to zoom without losing quality. More details are described in the Structure table subsection of the UGENE report section. mfold log. This report is portable, i.e., if the directory is completely copied (HTML+all PNGs+all PDFs), the copied data can be re-opened in the browser without loss of functionality. Folders can be deleted/renamed; it will not affect the operation of UGENE.\nTemporary output For advanced users.\nmfold produces many files. Not all of them are displayed in the reports. However, while the current UGENE session is open, you can see what other files mfold produces.\nIn the Log corresponding to the [Algorithms][DETAILS] subcategories, you can see the mfold launch command. It depends on where the UGENE temporary directory is set. For example, it might look like this\n“C:\\Program Files\\Unipro UGENE\\tools\\mfold\\mfold.bat” SEQ=C:\\tmp\\ugene_tmp\\p14120\\mfold\\d_0\\inp.fa RUN_TYPE=html NA=DNA LC=circular T=37 P=5 NA_CONC=1 MG_CONC=0 MAX=100 ROT_ANG=0\nIn this case, all temporary output files will be located in C:\\tmp\\ugene_tmp\\p14120\\mfold\\d_0. For information about the purpose and format of this data, please read the article.\nDo not modify/move/delete these files.

The concatenation approach is determined by the Multiplexing rule parameter.\nThere are the following multiplexing rules:\n1 to 1 1 to many Rule: 1 to 1 This rule means that the multiplexer gets one message from the first input port and one message from the second input port, joins them into a single message, and transfers it to the output. This procedure is repeated while there are available messages in both input ports.\nSee an example workflow below:\nAs you can see:\nThere are elements A, B, C, and the Multiplexer. A and B are data readers. A gets three data objects as input. These objects are denoted as I, II, and III. A has two slots, so the input data objects may also have various data. For example, this may be “Sequence” and “Set of annotations” slots, and the data are read from three GenBank files. B gets two data objects as input. These objects are denoted as IV and V. B also has two slots in this example. C gets messages in the workflow from B. It has one output slot. For example, this may be a “Set of annotations” slot, i.e. additional annotations were calculated for input objects IV and V. Now in the Multiplexer element we have three messages from A, that correspond to the three input objects I, II, and III. And we have two messages from B and C elements, that correspond to the two input objects IV and V with additional information, calculated in C. The multiplexing rule is “1 to 1”. This means that we only take into account messages that have a pair. Thus, “Message 3” is ignored in this case. However, the multiplexer concatenates the other messages. “Message 1” is concatenated with “Message 6”, and “Message 8” is produced. “Message 2” is concatenated with “Message 7”, and “Message 9” is produced. Rule: 1 to many This rule means that the multiplexer gets one message from the first input port, joins it with each message from the second input port, and transfers the joined messages to the output. This procedure is repeated for each message from the first input port.\nSee an example workflow below:\nAs you can see the conditions are the same as in the first “1 to 1” case, described above:\nAs on the first image there are elements A, B, C, and the Multiplexer. A and B are data readers. A gets three data objects as input. These objects are denoted as I, II, and III. A has two slots. B gets two data objects as input. These objects are denoted as IV and V. B has two slots. C gets messages in the workflow from B. It has one output slot. The Multiplexer element receives three messages from A and two messages from C. However, the multiplexing is done so that each message from A is concatenated from each message from C. As a result the following messages are produced:\n“Message 1” + “Message 6” = “Message 8” “Message 1” + “Message 7” = “Message 9” “Message 2” + “Message 6” = “Message 10” “Message 2” + “Message 7” = “Message 11” “Message 3” + “Message 6” = “Message 12” “Message 3” + “Message 7” = “Message 13” Element type: multiplexer\nParameters Parameter\nDescription\nDefault value\nParameter in Workflow File\nType\nMultiplexing rule\nAvailable values are:\n1 to 1 1 to many See the detailed description of the values above.\n1 to 1\nmultiplexing-rule\nstring\nInput/Output Ports The Multiplexer element has ports, but it has not slots.\nThe element has 2 input port:\nThe first input port: Name in GUI: First input port Name in Workflow File: input-data-1 The second input port: Name in GUI: Second input port Name in Workflow File: input-data-2 The element has 1 output port:\nName in GUI: Multiplexed output Name in Workflow File: output-data Element in Samples The element is used in the following workflow samples:\nFind Substrings in Sequences Merge Sequences and Annotations Search for TFBS ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Multiplexer Element The element allows you to join two data flows into …","ref":"/workflow-designer/workflow-elements/data-flow/multiplexer-element/","tags":"","title":"Multiplexer Element"},{"body":"MUSCLE Aligning To run the classic MUSCLE use the Align ‣ Align with MUSCLE context menu item in the Alignment Editor.\nThe dialog contains the list of MUSCLE modes: MUSCLE default, Large alignment, Refine only.\nBy default UGENE does not rearrange sequence order in an alignment, but the original MUSCLE package does.

The following options are available:\nILLUMINACLIP: Cutadapterandotherillumina-specific sequences from the read. SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality. TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality. CROP: Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length. AVGQUAL: Drop the read if the average quality is below the specified level. TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64. Each step has the own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases regardless of quality from the end of thread, so that the read has maximally the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step is used to find and remove Illumina adapters.\nTrimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match enough, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines) and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are now available by default. The naming of the various sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections which will still allow a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12 base sequence will score just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore the threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases) Trimmomatic is still able to identify very, very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog. To call the dialog press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length which is likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases, however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favours read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to an average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base (i.e. the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used removing the special Illumina \" low-quality segment\" regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. To remove a step use the Remove selected step button. The pink highlighting means the required parameter has not been set.\nKraken settings: Default Kraken parameters can be changed here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nDatabase\nA path to the folder with the Kraken database files.\nQuick operation\nStop classification of an input read after the certain number of hits.

So, as a good tradeoff between speed, precision, and RAM usage, it is recommended to set this value to 31 (along with the “Default” or “Express” mode).\nMinimumk-merfrequency\nMinimum of k-mer frequency/occurrence for the discriminative k-mers (-t).

These primers are typically between 18 and 24 bases in length and must code for only the specific upstream and downstream sites of the sequence being amplified. A primer that can bind to multiple regions along the DNA will amplify them all, eliminating the purpose of PCR.\nA few criteria must be brought into consideration when designing a pair of PCR primers. Pairs of primers should have similar melting temperatures since annealing during PCR occurs for both strands simultaneously, and this shared melting temperature must not be either too much higher or lower than the reaction’s annealing temperature. A primer with a _T_m (melting temperature) too much higher than the reaction’s annealing temperature may mishybridize and extend at an incorrect location along the DNA sequence. A _T_m significantly lower than the annealing temperature may fail to anneal and extend at all.\nAdditionally, primer sequences need to be chosen to uniquely select for a region of DNA, avoiding the possibility of hybridization to a similar sequence nearby.\nAlso, there are other parameters to be taken in account - Gibbs free energy, self- and heterodimers availability, etc. All parameters are described below in details.\nUGENE provides the “PCR Primer Design for DNA Assembly” feature only for nucleic sequences with the “Standard DNA” alphabet. To use it in UGENE open a DNA sequence and go to the “PCR Primer Design for DNA Assembly” tab of the Options Panel:\nThere are the following parameters:\nUser primers - the pair of forward and reverse primers user can check on the absence of unwanted connections (like hairpins, self- and hetero-dimers). Choose generated sequences as user primer’s end - user primers could be extended with the 8-bases sequences on 5’ and 3’ ends. These sequences do not form too simple unwanted connections (for example, “AAAATTTT”, obviously, has a hairpin, so there is no such a sequence in the list). Parameters of priming sequences - the range of melting temperature, Gibbs free energy and length primers SHOULD have. Parameters to exclude in whole primers - the minimum melting temperature, the maximum Gibbs free energy and the maximum base pairs length which may be present in the self- and hetero-dimers in the considered primer. Select areas for priming search - select areas to search forward and reverse primers in. Open the backbone sequence - choose a sequence to be added to 5’ or 3’ end of the result primer. Other sequences in PCR reaction - the list of sequence to check the unwanted connections with. The unwanted connections should fit to “Parameters to exclude in whole primers”. Designing primers Physical quantity The designed primers should have the set Gibbs free energy, melting temperature and length. Also, these primers could have hairpins, self- and hetero-dimers, but the mentioned parameters of these found dimers should be limited. Look at the pictures:\nThe found primer “GATGGTGATGTTAATGGGCAC” has Gibbs free energy between -40 and -30 kcal/mol, melting temperature between 51 and 65 °C and length between 18 and 25 nucleotides. Also, there are no heirpins, self- and hetero-dimers in this primer, which has Gibbs free energy more then -7 kcal/mol, melting temperature less than 20 °C and base pairs length more than 3 nucleotides.\nRegions Forward primers are searched at the left region, reverse primers are searched at the right region. There is an amplified fragment between them:\nThe left search area is from 1 to 71 base, the right search area is from 355 to 426 base. The amplified fragment between them.\nBackbone sequence Backbone sequence is the sequence that is added to 5’ end of the primer for the following assembly of the PCR product with the backbone molecule. This parameter is optional. You may set the backbone sequence, the sequence end you want to add backbone to and the length of the sequence from 5’ and 3’ ends to check if these sequences have unwanted hairpins, self- and hetero-dimers. On the pictures below you may see the differences between “5’ insert to 5’ backbone” and “5’ insert to 3’ backbone” (“insert” in this case is the same as “primer”).\nIf you set “5’ backbone length”, then the number of bases you set from 5’ end of the backbone sequence will be checked for unwanted connections. The same about “3’ backbone length”, but from the 3’ end. If the checked end has hairpins, self- and homo-dimers you will see the following dialog:\nBackbone details Other sequences in PCR reactions Sequences that are supposed to be in the reaction mixture. Its important primers do not have unwanted connections to these sequences, so it will be checked that there are no hairpins, self- or hetero-dimers between the resulting primer and any sequence from the “Other sequences in PCR reaction” file.\nResult The search result is from 1 to 4 pairs of primers. The results should be as close as possible to the amplified fragment. That means, that the searching process starts from the edge of the amplified fragment to the 5’ direction on the direct strand in case of the forward primer and to the 3’ direction of the reverse-complementary strand in case of the reverse primer. The results are defined with special names:\nA - the pair of primers closest to the amplified fragment, corresponding to the entire set of parameters. B1 - the pair of primers closest to the amplified fragment, corresponding to the entire set of parameters if B2 and/or B3 exist. B2 - the pair of primers corresponding to the entire set of parameters, which has a 4-nucleotide intersection with B1. B3 - the pair of primers corresponding to the entire set of parameters, which starts immediately when B1 ends. Also, you may see results in the result table.

If a region is not selected the whole sequence will be analyzed.\nThe following dialog will appear where you can choose the search options:\nGeneral options are:\nSelect the search type — in the remote databases the blastn search is used for nucleotide sequences, blastp and cdd searches are used for amino sequences.\nUGENE also provides a way to use blastp and cdd searches for nucleotide sequences. This is achieved by translating the nucleotide sequence into the amino sequences.\nWhen a sequence is translated the translation table from the active Sequence View is used. Finally, all 6 translations are used to query the remote database with the selected blastp or cdd search.\nExpectation value — this option specifies the statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences. Lower expect thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported.\nMax hits — the maximum number of hits that will be shown (not equal to number of annotations). The maximum availablle number is 5000.\nDatabase — the target database.\nSearch for short, nearly exact matches — automatically adjusts the word size and other parameters to improve results for short queries.\nMegablast — select this option to compare query with closely related sequences. It works best if the target percent identity is 95% or more, but it is very fast.\nYou can see the description of the annotation saving parameters here.\nSearch timeout — the remote task terminated if the timeout is reached.\nThere is a little difference in default values of parameters between NCBI Nucleotide BLAST web interface and UGENE:\nThe web interface uses the megablast option by default: the search is fast, but only highly similar sequences are found. UGENE ignores the option by default: the search may take more time, but all somewhat similar sequences are found. Check the Megablast option, if you want exactly the same results to be found in UGENE as you had in the NCBI web interface.\nAlso there is Advanced options tab:\nThe view of the Advanced options tab depends on the selected search. For the blastn search it looks like on the picture above.\nWord size — the size of the subsequence parameter for the initiated search.\nGap costs — costs to create and extend a gap in an alignment. Increasing the Gap costs will result in alignments which decrease the number of Gaps introduced.\nMatch scores — reward and penalty for matching and mismatching bases.\nEntrez query — a BLAST search can be limited to the result of an Entrez query against the database chosen. This restricts the search to a subset of entries from that database fitting the requirement of the Entrez query. Examples are given below:\nprotease NOT hiv1[organism] — this will limit a BLAST search to all proteases, except those in HIV 1.\n1000:2000[slen] — this limits the search to entries with lengths between 1000 to 2000 bases for nucleotide entries, or 1000 to 2000 residues for protein entries.\nMus musculus[organism] AND biomol_mrna[properties] — this limits the search to mouse mRNA entries in the database. For common organisms, one can also select from the pulldown menu.\n10000:100000[mlwt] — this is yet another example usage, which limits the search to protein sequences with calculated molecular weight between 10 kD to 100 kD.\nsrc specimen voucher[properties] — this limits the search to entries that are annotated with a /specimen_voucher qualifier on the source feature.\nall[filter] NOT enviromnental sample[filter] NOT metagenomes[orgn] — this excludes sequences from metagenome studies and uncultured sequences from anonymous environmental sample studies.\nFor help in constructing Entrez queries see the Entrez Help document.\nFilters — filters for regions of low compositional complexity and repeat elements of the human’s genome.\nMasks for lookup table only — this option masks only for purposes of constructing the lookup table used by BLAST so that no hits are found based upon low-complexity sequence or repeats (if repeat filter is checked).\nMask lower case letters — with this option selected you can cut and paste a FASTA sequence in upper case characters and denote areas you would like filtered with lower case.\nFilter by — filters results by accession, by definition of annotations or by id.\nSelect result by — selects results by EValue or by score.\nWhen the blastp search is selected in the general options, the view of the Advanced options tab is the following:\nAs you can see there is no Match scores option, but there are Matrix and Service options.\nMatrix — key element in evaluating the quality of a pair-wise sequence alignment is the “substitution matrix”, which assigns a score for aligning any possible pair of residues.\nService — blastp service which needs to be performed: plain, psi or phi.\nThe Advanced options tab is not available when the cdd search is selected.\nPrimer-BLAST Exporting BLAST Results to Alignment Fetching Sequences from Remote Database ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Remote BLAST The Remote BLAST plugin provides a capability to annotate …","ref":"/extensions/remote-blast/","tags":"","title":"Remote BLAST"},{"body":"Remote BLAST Element Finds annotations for the supplied DNA sequence in the NCBI remote database.\nElement type: blast\nParameters Parameter\nDescription\nDefault value\nParameter in Workflow File\nType\nDatabase\nSelects the database to search through.

The output homologous sequences and the original sequences, annotated by BLAST, are grouped by folders.\nEnvironment Requirements\nInternet connection is required for running this workflow sample.\nHow to Use This Sample\nIf you haven’t used the workflow samples in UGENE before, look at the “How to Use Sample Workflows” section of the documentation.\nWorkflow Sample Location The workflow sample “Remote BLASTing” can be found in the “Scenarios” section of the Workflow Designer samples.\nWorkflow Image The opened workflow looks as follows:\nWorkflow Wizard The wizard has 3 pages.\nInput Sequence(s) Page: On this page you must input at least one nucleotide sequence.\nExample Input Data\nFor example, you can use the following two files as an input to the workflow:\nmy_sequence1.fa my_sequence2.fa Remote Nucleotide BLAST Page: Here you can optionally modify parameters that should be used for the remote BLAST queries. For example, you can select the search database, correct the e-value and set the maximum number of results (i.e. “Max hits”). The “Megablast” option, applied by default, specifies to optimize the search for high similar sequences only. Selecting it decreases the search time, but some less similar results could be skipped by the search in this case. Note that the “Megablast” option is also applied by default in the NCBI BLAST web interface.\nThere are also some additional parameters. Description of them can be found in the Remote BLAST workflow element chapter of the documentation.\nOutput Files Page: this is an informational page. It states that this workflow has predefined names of the output files. For each input sequence the workflow outputs:\n“orig_with_blast.gb” file: the file contains the input sequence itself and the “blast result” annotations; “homologous.gb” file: the file contains the found homologous sequences loaded from the NCBI by identifiers, specified in the BLAST results. The results on the hard drive are grouped by folders (see below).\nThe wizard page looks as follows:\nWorkflow Result The workflow output files are shown in the dashboard as follows:\nEach file can be opened in the UGENE Sequence View by clicking on the corresponding link in the dashboard.\nOn the hard drive the output is grouped by folders with the names of the input sequences.

This enzymes will be searched after clicking OK.\nSelected enzyme info Some information about the enzyme selected. It includes name, link to the REBASE database, the enzyme type detailed information, number of enzymes in the current sequence and sites and cuts location.\nControl buttons (right side) Open enzymes - open file with enzymes in the bairoch format. It is required if you want to update enzymes database or open a database with some limited amount of enzymes. See Using Custom File with Enzymes for details. Export enzymes - export selected enzymes to the separate file (using the bairoch format). Select all - check all enzymes in the tree. Select none - uncheck all enzymes in the tree. Select by length - check enzymes only if its recognition site has length more than you set in the dialog window appeared. Invert selection - switch checked and unchecked enzymes. Load selection - load selected enzymes from the file. This file should contain comma-separated enzyme name list, for example: BamHI,BglII,ClaI,DraI,EcoRI,EcoRV,HindIII,PstI,SalI,SmaI,XmaI Save selection - save checked enzymes to the separate file using the format, described above.

The following options are available:\nILLUMINACLIP: Cutadapterandotherillumina-specific sequences from the read. SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality. TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality. CROP: Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length. AVGQUAL: Drop the read if the average quality is below the specified level. TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64. Each step has the own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases regardless of quality from the end of thread, so that the readhas maximally the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step is used to find and remove Illumina adapters.\nTrimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match enough, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines) and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are now available by default. The naming of the various sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections which will still allow a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12 base sequence will score just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore the threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases) Trimmomatic is still able to identify very, very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog. To call the dialog press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length which is likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases, however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favours read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to an average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base (i.e. the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used removing the special Illumina \" low-quality segment\" regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. To remove a step use the Remove selected step button. The pink highlighting means the required parameter has not been set.\nTopHat settings: TopHat parameters can be set here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nReference genome\nPath to the indexed reference genome.\nKnown transcript file\nA set of gene model annotations and/or known transcripts.\nLibrary type\nSpecifies RNA-Seq protocol.\nRead mismatches\nFinal read alignments having more than these many mismatches are discarded.\nMate inner distance\nThe expected (mean) inner distance between mate pairs.\nMate standard deviation\nThe standard deviation for the distribution on inner distances between mate pairs.\nMin anchor length\nThe anchor length. TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction. Note that individual spliced alignments may span a junction with fewer than this many bases on one side. However, every junction involved in spliced alignments is supported by at least one read with this many bases on each side.\nSplice mismatches\nThe maximum number of mismatches that may appear in the anchor region of a spliced alignment.\nMax multihits\nInstruct TopHat to allow up to this many alignments to the reference for a given read and suppresses all alignments for reads with more than this many alignments.\nRaw junctions\nThe list of raw junctions.\nNo novel junctions\nOnly look for reads across junctions indicated in the supplied GFF or junctions file. This parameter is ignored if Raw junctions or Known transcript file is not set.\nStringTie settings: StringTie parameters can be set here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nReference annotations\nUse the reference annotation file (in GTF or GFF3 format) to guide the assembly process (-G). The output will include expressed reference transcripts as well as any novel transcripts that are assembled.\nReads orientation\nSelect the NGS libraries type: unstranded, stranded fr-secondstrand (–fr), or stranded fr-firststand (–rf).\nMin assembled transcript length\nSpecify the minimum length for the predicted transcripts (-m).\nMin anchor length for junctions\nJunctions that don’t have spliced reads that align them with at least this amount of bases on both sides is filtered out (-a).\nMin junction coverage\nThere should be at least this many spliced reads that align across a junction (-j). This number can be fractional since some reads align in more than one place. A read that aligns in n places will contribute 1/n to the junction coverage.\nTrim transcripts based on coverage\nBy default StringTie adjusts the predicted transcript’s start and/or stop coordinates based on sudden drops in coverage of the assembled transcript. Set this parameter to “False” to disable the trimming at the ends of the assembled transcripts (-t).\nMin coverage for assembled transcripts\nSpecifies the minimum read coverage allowed for the predicted transcripts (-c). A transcript with a lower coverage than this value is not shown in the output. This number can be fractional since some reads align in more than one place. A read that aligns in n places will contribute 1/n to the coverage.\nMin locus gap separation\nReads that are mapped closer than this distance are merged together in the same processing bundle (-g).\nFraction covered by multi-hit reads\nSpecify the maximum fraction of muliple-location-mapped reads that are allowed to be present at a given locus (-M). A read that aligns in n places will contribute 1/n to the coverage.\nSkip assembling for sequences\nIgnore all read alignments (and thus do not attempt to perform transcript assembly) on the specified reference sequences (-x). The value can be a single reference sequence name (e.g. “chrM”) or a comma-delimited list of sequence names (e.g. “chrM,chrX,chrY”). This can speed up StringTie especially in the case of excluding the mitochondrial genome, whose genes may have very high coverage in some cases, even though they may be of no interest for a particular RNA-Seq analysis. The reference sequence names are case sensitive, they must match identically the names of chromosomes/contigs of the target genome against which the RNA-Seq reads were aligned in the first place.\nMulti-mapping correction\nEnables or disables (-u) multi-mapping correction.\nVerbose log\nEnable detailed logging, if required (-v). The messages will be written to the UGENE log (enabling of “DETAILS” and “TRACE” logging may be required) and to the dashboard.\nLabel\nUse the specified string as the prefix for the name of the output transcripts (-l).\nOutput Files Page: On this page, output directories can be selected:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"RNA-Seq Analysis with TopHat and StringTie The workflow sample, …","ref":"/workflow-designer/workflow-samples/ngs/rna-seq-analysis-with-tophat-and-stringtie/","tags":"","title":"RNA-Seq Analysis with TopHat and StringTie"},{"body":"RNA-seq Analysis with Tuxedo Tools The RNA-seq pipeline “Tuxedo” consists of the TopHat spliced read mapper, that internally uses Bowtie or Bowtie 2 short read aligners, and several Cufflinks tools that allows one to assemble transcripts, estimate their abundances, and tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-seq samples.\nEnvironment Requirements\nThe pipeline is currently available on Linux and macOS systems only.\nHow to Use This Sample\nIf you haven’t used the workflow samples in UGENE before, look at the “How to Use Sample Workflows” section of the documentation.\nWorkflow Sample Location The workflow sample “RNA-seq Analysis with Tuxedo Tools” can be found in the “NGS” section of the Workflow Designer samples.\nWorkflow Image There are two short reads types of workflow: single-end and paired-end reads.

For Full Tuxedo Pipeline analysis type and paired-end reads type wizard has 7 pages.\nInput data: Here you need to input RNA-seq short reads in FASTA or FASTQ formats. Many datasets with different reads can be added.\nCuffdiff Samples: Here you need to divide the input datasets into samples for running Cuffdiff. There are must be at least 2 samples. It is not necessary to have the same number of datasets (replicates) for each sample. The samples names will be used by Cuffdiff as labels, which will be included in various output files produced by Cuffdiff.\nTophat Settings: Here you can configure TopHat settings.

This parameter is ignored if Raw junctions or Known transcript file is not set.\nMax multihints\nInstructs TopHat to allow up to this many alignments to the reference for a given read, and suppresses all alignments for reads with more than this many alignments.\nSegment length\nEach read is cut up into segments, each at least this long. These segments are mapped independently.\nFusion search\nTurn on fusion mapping.\nTranscritome max hits\nOnly align the reads to the transcriptome and report only those mappings as genomic mappings.\nPrefilter multihints\nWhen mapping reads on the transcriptome, some repetitive or low complexity reads that would be discarded in the context of the genome may appear to align to the transcript sequences and thus may end up reported as mapped to those genes only. This option directs TopHat to first align the reads to the whole genome in order to determine and exclude such multi-mapped reads (according to the value of the Max multihits option).\nMin anchor length\nThe anchor length. TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction. Note that individual spliced alignments may span a junction with fewer than this many bases on one side. However, every junction involved in spliced alignments is supported by at least one read with this many bases on each side.\nSplice mismatches\nThe maximum number of mismatches that may appear in the anchor region of a spliced alignment.\nRead mismatches\nFinal read alignments having more than these many mismatches are discarded.\nSegment mismatches\nRead segments are mapped independently, allowing up to this many mismatches in each segment alignment.\nSolexa 1.3 quals\nAs of the Illumina GA pipeline version 1.3, quality scores are encoded in Phred-scaled base-64.

Read segments are always mapped using -v option.\nBowtie tool path\nThe path to the Bowtie external tool.\nSAMtools tool path\nThe path to the SAMtools tool. Note that the tool is available in the UGENE External Tool Package.\nTopHat tool path\nThe path to the TopHat external tool in UGENE.\nTemporary directory\nThe directory for temporary files.\nCufflinks Settings: The following page allows one to configure Cufflinks settings:\nThe following parameters are available:\nReference annotation\nTells Cufflinks to use the supplied reference annotation to estimate isoform expression. Cufflinks will not assemble novel transcripts and the program will ignore alignments not structurally compatible with any reference transcript.\nRABT annotation\nTells Cufflinks to use the supplied reference annotation to guide Reference Annotation Based Transcript (RABT) assembly. Reference transcripts will be tiled with faux-reads to provide additional information in an assembly. The output will include all reference transcripts as well as any novel genes and isoforms that are assembled.\nLibrary type\nSpecifies RNA-seq protocol.\nMask file\nIgnore all reads that could have come from transcripts in this file. It is recommended to include any annotated rRNA, mitochondrial transcripts other abundant transcripts you wish to ignore in your analysis in this file. Due to variable efficiency of mRNA enrichment methods and rRNA depletion kits, masking these transcripts often improves the overall robustness of transcript abundance estimates.\nMulti-read correct\nTells Cufflinks to do an initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads mapping to multiple locations in the genome.\nMin isoform fraction\nAfter calculating isoform abundance for a gene, Cufflinks filters out transcripts that it believes are very low abundance, because isoforms expressed at extremely low levels often cannot reliably be assembled, and may even be artifacts of incompletely spliced precursors of processed transcripts. This parameter is also used to filter out introns that have far fewer spliced alignments supporting them.\nFrag bias correct\nProviding Cufflinks with a multifasta file via this option instructs it to run the bias detection and correction algorithm which can significantly improve accuracy of transcript abundance estimates.\nPre-mRNA fraction\nSome RNA-Seq protocols produce a significant amount of reads that originate from incompletely spliced transcripts, and these reads can confound the assembly of fully spliced mRNAs. Cufflinks uses this parameter to filter out alignments that lie within the intronic intervals implied by the spliced alignments. The minimum depth of coverage in the intronic region covered by the alignment is divided by the number of spliced reads, and if the result is lower than this parameter value, the intronic alignments are ignored.\nCufflinks tool path\nThe path to the Cufflinks external tool in UGENE.\nTemporary directory\nThe directory for temporary files.\nCuffmerge settings: On this page, you can modify Cuffmerge parameters.\nThe following parameters are available:\nMinimum isoform fraction\nDiscard isoforms with abundance below this.\nReference annotation\nMerge the input assemblies together with this reference annotation.\nReference sequence\nThe genomic DNA sequences for the reference. It is used to assist in classifying transfrags and excluding artifacts (e.g. repeats). For example, transcripts consisting mostly of lower-case bases are classified as repeats.\nCuffcompare tool path\nThe path to the Cuffcompare external tool in UGENE.\nCuffmerge tool path\nThe path to the Cuffmerge external tool in UGENE.\nTemporary directory\nThe directory for temporary files.\nCuffdiff settings: On the following page you may configure Cuffdiff settings:\nThe following parameters are available:\nTime series analysis\nIf set to True, instructs Cuffdiff to analyze the provided samples as a time series, rather than testing for differences between all pairs of samples. Samples should be provided in increasing time order.\nUpper quartile norm\nIf set to True, normalizes by the upper quartile of the number of fragments mapping to individual loci instead of the total number of sequenced fragments. This can improve the robustness of differential expression calls for less abundant genes and transcripts.\nHits norm\nInstructs how to count all fragments. Total specifies to count all fragments, including those not compatible with any reference transcript, towards the number of mapped fragments used in the FPKM denominator. Compatible specifies to use only compatible fragments. Selecting Compatible is generally recommended in Cuffdiff to reduce certain types of bias caused by differential amounts of ribosomal reads which can create the impression of falsely differentially expressed genes.\nFrag bias correct\nProviding the sequences your reads were mapped to instructs Cuffdiff to run bias detection and correction algorithm which can significantly improve the accuracy of transcript abundance estimates.\nMulti read correct\nDo an initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads mapping to multiple locations in the genome.\nLibrary type\nSpecifies RNA-Seq protocol.\nMask file\nIgnore all reads that could have come from transcripts in this file. It is recommended to include any annotated rRNA, mitochondrial transcripts other abundant transcripts you wish to ignore in your analysis in this file. Due to variable efficiency of mRNA enrichment methods and rRNA depletion kits, masking these transcripts often improves the overall robustness of transcript abundance estimates.\nMin alignment count\nThe minimum number of alignments in a locus for needed to conduct significance testing on changes in that locus observed between samples. If no testing is performed, changes in the locus are deemed not significant, and the locus’ observed changes don’t contribute to correction for multiple testing.\nFDR\nAllowed false discovery rate used in testing.\nMax MLE iterations\nSets the number of iterations allowed during maximum likelihood estimation of abundances.\nEmit count tables\nInclude information about the fragment counts, fragment count variances, and fitted variance model into the report.\nCuffdiff tool path\nThe path to the Cuffdiff external tool in UGENE.\nTemporary directory\nThe directory for temporary files.\nOutput data: On this page, you can modify output parameters.\nThe work on this pipeline was supported by grant RUB1-31097-NO-12 from NIAID.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"RNA-seq Analysis with Tuxedo Tools The RNA-seq pipeline “Tuxedo” …","ref":"/workflow-designer/workflow-samples/ngs/rna-seq-analysis-with-tuxedo-tools/","tags":"","title":"RNA-seq Analysis with Tuxedo Tools"},{"body":"RTPCR Primer Design This feature allows to search for primer pairs that span introns on the genomic sequence or exon junctions on the mRNA sequence.\nNote that RT-PCR design is only available for mRNA/cDNA sequences with annotated exons. There are several ways to obtain the cDNA for a corresponding DNA sequence.\nFrom NCBI or ENSEMBL database. For example, one can download the TMPRSS2 transcript variant 1 from NCBI Genbank using identifier NM_001135099.1. This can be also done from UGENE using option Access remote database or Search NCBI Genbank.\nAlign the genomic and cDNA sequences using spliced aligner. For this option one must have both genomic and cDNA sequences. In UGENE the spliced alignment can be performed using the Spidey tool. To run the alignment open the genomic sequence and select action Align ‣ Align to mRNA sequence. The generated exon annotations can be then exported using action Export ‣ Export sequence of selected annotations\nTo design primers for your mRNA sequence and go to the RT-PCR tab of the Primer Designer dilaog:\nThe following parameters are available:\nExon annotation name\nTo detect exon boundaries UGENE searches for exonic annotations. This option allows to set custom name for annotations denoting exons. Default value is “exon”\nMinimum exon junction overlap size\nIf checked, then only the pairs with at least one of the primers overlapping exon junction in the mRNA sequence will be selected.\nAt 5’ side (bp)\nMinimum overlap size on the 5’ side of the exon junction. Default is 5 bp.\nAt 3’ side (bp)\nMinimum overlap size on the 3’ side of the exon junction. Default is 5 bp.\nExon range\nThis option allows to limit the sequence region, where the primers are searched for. For example, setting value “3-5” will limit the search to a sequence region consisting of exons 3,4,5 of the transcript, as defined by the order in the sequence. Default value is an empty string, which means that there are no limitations.\nSpan at least one intron\nThis option makes sure that primer product should span an intron on the genomic sequence i.e the forward and reverse primers must be located in different exons. The option is enabled by default.\n_Max numbers of pairs to query _\nThe algorithm applied in RT-PCR primer design first searches for all available primers in a given sequence. Then it filters the detected pairs to make sure that they satisfy the selected configuration. This option allows to set the maximum number of pairs for the initial search query. Larger number will result in increased sensitivity, but also in a longer running time. Default value is 1000**.**\nImportant: using the RT-PCR primer design tab will reset the values set in the Exlcuded regions and Targets of the Main configuration tab. Additionally if the Exon range option is set, the defined sequence region will be ignored.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"RTPCR Primer Design This feature allows to search for primer pairs …","ref":"/extensions/primer3/rtpcr-primer-design/","tags":"","title":"RTPCR Primer Design"},{"body":"Ruler and Coverage Graph Description The Ruler shows the coordinates in the Reads Area.

The algorithm can be one of the following:\nInsDel — there could be insertions and/or deletions, i.e. a pattern and the searched region can vary in their length. You can specify the percentage of the pattern and a searched region match in the field nearby. Note that this value also depends on the pattern length and is disabled when the pattern hasn’t been specified. Substitute — a pattern may contain characters different from the characters in the searched region.

The following options are available:\nILLUMINACLIP: Cutadapterandotherillumina-specific sequences from the read. SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality. TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality. CROP: Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length. AVGQUAL: Drop the read if the average quality is below the specified level. TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64. Each step has the own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases regardless of quality from the end of thread, so that the readhas maximally the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step is used to find and remove Illumina adapters.\nTrimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match enough, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines) and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are now available by default. The naming of the various sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections which will still allow a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12 base sequence will score just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore the threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases) Trimmomatic is still able to identify very, very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog. To call the dialog press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length which is likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases, however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favours read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to an average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base (i.e. the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used removing the special Illumina \" low-quality segment\" regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. To remove a step use the Remove selected step button. The pink highlighting means the required parameter has not been set.\nKraken settings: Default Kraken parameters can be changed here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nDatabase\nA path to the folder with the Kraken database files.\nQuick operation\nStop classification of an input read after the certain number of hits. The value can be specified in the “Minimum number of hits” parameter.\nCLARK settings: Default CLARK parameters can be changed here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nDatabase\nA folder that should be used to store the database files.\nK-mer length\nThis value is critical for the classification accuracy and speed.\nFor high sensitivity, it is recommended to set this value to 20 or 21 (along with the “Full” mode).\nHowever, if the precision and the speed are the main concern, use any value between 26 and 32.\nNote that the higher the value, the higher is the RAM usage. So, as a good tradeoff between speed, precision, and RAM usage, it is recommended to set this value to 31 (along with the “Default” or “Express” mode).\nMinimum k-mer frequency\nMinimum of k-mer frequency/occurrence for the discriminative k-mers(-t). For example, for 1 (or, 2), the program will discard any discriminative k-mer that appear only once (or, less than twice).\nMode\nSet the mode of the execution (-m):\n“Full” to get detailed results, confidence scores, and other statistics. “Default” to get results summary and perform the best trade-off between classification speed, accuracy and RAM usage. “Express” to get results summary with the highest speed possible. Sampling factor value\nGap\n“Gap” or number of non-overlapping k-mers to pass when creating the database (-п).\nIncrease the value if it is required to reduce the RAM usage.

The Smith-Waterman Search dialog appears:\nAlgorithm This search algorithm has a huge calculation time advantage over the usual Search in sequence algorithm for large sequences. It happens, because the “Search in sequence” algorithm represents a suffix algorithm - one sequence moves along the other and areas opposite each other are иуштп compared. Using this approach, the computation time increases in direct proportion to the length of the sequence. The Smith-Waterman algorithm represents absolutely another approach - searching using a certain kind of matrices.\nThe algorithm works in a following way:\nA matrix is createad where the sequence in which the search is carried out is located vertically, and the searched sequence is located horizontally. Fill the adjacent row and column with 0. Example: The sequence in which the search is carried out - ACGCGAT. The searched sequence - CGCG.\nD(i,j)\nC\nG\nC\nG\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nA\n0\nC\n0\nG\n0\nC\n0\nG\n0\nA\n0\nT\n0\nStart filling the matrix from the left top corner moving from left to right and from top to bottom using the following formula: Where: D(S1, S2) - current cell, D(S1-1, S2) - the cell on the left, D(S1, S2-1) - the cell above, D(S1-1, S2-1) - the on the top and left, gap - the Gap open penalty if we meet gap for the first time and the Gap extension penalty if we meet gap the second time or more. score - the value from the Scoring matrix table. The following example uses nucl Scoring matrix (+5 for match, -4 for mismatch) and -1 for Gap open and Gap extension penalties:\nFind the greater number and move to the top, left or top-left to the next greater number: Matching green symbols indicate the desired sequence intersection.\nParameters First of all you need to specify the pattern to search for. The rest parameters are optional:\nSearch in — select either to search in the sequence or in its amino acid translation.\nStrand — select the strand to search in: direct, reverse-complementary or both strands.\nRegion — specifies the region of the sequence that will be used to search for the pattern. By default, if a subsequence has been selected when the dialog has been opened, then the selected subsequence is searched for the pattern. Otherwise, the whole sequence is used. You can also input a custom range.\nAlgorithm version — version of the algorithm implementation. All versions produce the same result - only the inner technology is used in a different ways:\nClassic 2 - classical implementation of the algorithm. Works everywhere. SSE2 - the algorithm, which works much faster, but requires you to have SSE2 processor. Scoring matrix — can be chosen from a bunch of matrices supplied with UGENE. To view a matrix selected click the View button.\nGap open — penalty for opening a gap.\nGap extension — penalty for extending a gap.\nReport results — simple heuristic which allows to filter intersected hits. If it is set to none, the algorithm may report large set of almost identical results in the same region.\nMinimal score — another simple heuristic which measures sequences similarity. It is more convenient than using some abstract scores. If set to 100%, the algorithm will search for exact substring match.\nInput and output The results of the search are saved as annotations or as multiple alignment.

It annotates and predicts the effects of genetic variants (such as amino acid changes).\nA typical SnpEff use case would be: -Input: The inputs are predicted variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, and MNPs). The input file is usually obtained as a result of a sequencing experiment, and it is usually in variant call format (VCF). -Output: SnpEff analyzes the input variants. It annotates the variants and calculates the effects they produce on known genes (e.g. amino acid changes).\nHow to Use This Sample\nIf you haven’t used the workflow samples in UGENE before, look at the “How to Use Sample Workflows” section of the documentation.\nWorkflow Sample Location The workflow sample “Variation Annotation with SnpEff” can be found in the “NGS” section of the Workflow Designer samples.\nWorkflow Image The opened workflow looks as follows:\nWorkflow Wizard The wizard has 4 pages.\nInput Variations: On this page, you must input variations file(s).\nChange chromosome notation for variations: On this page you can change the chromosome notation for variations.\nThe following parameters are available:\nReplace prefixes\nInput the list of chromosome prefixes that you would like to replace.

As well as for the SITECON, the main use case of the plugin is recognition of potential transcription factor binding sites on basis of the data about conservative conformational and physicochemical properties revealed with the binding sites sets analysis.\nThe Weight Matrix contains a lot of position frequency matrices (PFM ‘s) and position weight matrices (PWM ‘s, also known as position specific score matrices — PSSM ‘s). The matrices came from two wide-known open archives: JASPAR, which contains frequency matrices, and UniPROBE containing weight matrices.\nAlso the Weight Matrix plugin provides a tool for creating specific position frequency and weight matrices from an existing alignment or from a file with several sequences. The created matrix can be used as a profile for the search as well as the JASPAR and UNIPROBE ones.\nTo search for transcription factor binding sites in a DNA sequence select the Analyze ‣ Search TFBS with matrices context menu item. The Weight matrix search dialog will appear:\nIn the search dialog you must specify a file with PWM or PFM. You can do so by pressing the browse button and selecting the file.\nAlso you can use the special interface to choose a JASPAR matrix by pressing the Search JASPAR database button.\nAlternative way to specify the position weight/frequency matrix is to create a specific one from an alignment or a file with several sequences with the build a new matrix tool.\nAfter the profile (the matrix) is loaded, you can adjust the threshold value. The threshold sets the minimal identity score for a result to pass. The more the result score is, the more it is homologically related to the aligned region. By changing the threshold you can filter low- scoring results.\nIf the loaded matrix is a position frequency matrix, you must also specify the algorithm to build the corresponding position weight matrix which will represent the transcription factor. There are four algorithms available.\nAlso you can add a selected matrix with the specified Minimal score and the Algorithm to the matrices list. To do it, select the matrix and other options and press the Add to queue button. The plugin will search with all matrices specified in the list.\nYou can use the Save list button to export the list of matrices to a *.csv file. Later the list can be loaded from the file using the Load list button.\nThe rest options are standard sequence search options: the strand and the sequence region where to search for matches.\nAfter specifying the necessary options press the Search button. The found results will appear in the dialog table. The corresponding results identity scores are in the Score column.\nAlso you can see the matrix by using the View matrix button:\nThe regions found by the weight matrix algorithm can be saved as annotations to the DNA sequence in the Genbank format by pressing the Save as annotations button.\nAfter saving, the file with resulting annotations will be automatically added to the current project, and the annotations will be added to the original sequence.\nNote that in case of selecting JASPAR or UNIPROBE matrix, the resulting annotations will contain the given matrix properties.\nSee

It consists of workflow elements and their connections.\nworkflow element\nAn element of a workflow. Different elements are used to read data from files on disk, perform some algorithms and to write data to files on disk. Each element contains one or several input and output ports.\nelement connection\nConnection between two elements specifies that data in output port of one element should be passed to a matching input port of another element.\ninput port\nAn input port of an element is used to collect data from another element. A workflow element may have several input ports. On the Scene such port is displayed as a right semicircle.\noutput port\nAn output port of an element is used to provide data to another element. A workflow element may have one output port or none. On the Scene the port is displayed as a left semicircle.\nslot\nEach port has one or several slots. A slot is the smallest passageway to transfer the workflow data through. It has a certain type (e.g. “Sequence”, “Set of annotations”, etc.). So, for example, only sequence data can be passed through a sequence slot.\nThus, an input port has one or several input slots. These slots specify data that are expected as input by the element. An output port has one or several output slots. These slots specify data that the element produces.\nIn a workflow, an element usually have access to slots of the connected elements, located in the workflow before it.\nmessage\nA message is a single data chunk, transferred from an output slot of one element to an input slot of another element. The slots must have the same type to make the transfer possible.\nThe Scene is initially empty and you start with creating a workflow on it:\nSee an example of a workflow on the image below:\nYour first step is to add necessary workflow elements, for example, by dragging them from the Palette to the Scene:\nThe added element can be moved around on the Scene by dragging it and can be resized by dragging its borders. Read chapter Manipulating Element to learn what else you can do with workflow elements.\nIf you have two elements with matching output and input ports, you can make the connection by dragging the arrow between the ports:\nAll matching ports of available processes are highlighted while you drag the arrow, besides the arrow sticks to a near match when you drag closer. If an element has a sole matching port, you can just drop the arrow on the element itself to create a correct connection.\nOnce created, a connection will follow movements of the linked elements; you cannot redirect or reshape the connection arrow but only remove it. You can move the port around an element that it belongs to by dragging it and holding the Alt key at the same time.
