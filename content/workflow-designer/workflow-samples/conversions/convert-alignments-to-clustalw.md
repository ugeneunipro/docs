# Convert Alignments to ClustalW

This workflow converts multiple alignment file(s) of any format to ClustalW document(s). If the source file is a sequence format (e.g., FASTA), all contained sequences are added to the resulting alignment. However, no real alignment is performed; this particular workflow illustrates pure data format conversion.
