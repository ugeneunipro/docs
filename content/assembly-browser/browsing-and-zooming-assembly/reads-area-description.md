# Reads Area Description

The _Reads Area_ provides a visualization of reads of an assembly part. To zoom in or zoom out, rotate the mouse wheel.

You can also use the _Zoom In_ and _Zoom Out_ buttons on the toolbar or the _Actions ‣ Zoom In_ and _Actions ‣ Zoom Out_ items in the main menu for zooming.

Additionally, when you double-click on a read, it zooms in and moves to the center of the window.

By dragging the mouse while holding the left mouse button, you can navigate in the Reads Area.

To navigate long distances in the Reads Area, use the _Assembly Overview_ described [_below_](assembly-overview-description).

Other ways to navigate in the assembly include:

*   Using the horizontal and vertical scroll bars of the Reads Area
*   [_Going to a specified position in an assembly_](go-to-position-in-assembly)

To learn about available hotkeys, refer to [_Assembly Browser Hotkeys_](assembly-browser-hotkeys.md).

By default, assembly rendering is optimized while scrolling. While you move across an assembly, it shows the assembly in gray color, but when you stop, it shows the assembly in different colors. To disable this option, uncheck the _Optimize the rendering while scrolling_ item in the context menu of the _Reads Area_ or the _Optimize scrolling_ item on the _Assembly Browser Settings_ tab of the _Options Panel_.
