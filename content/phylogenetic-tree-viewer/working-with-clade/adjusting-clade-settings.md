# Adjusting Clade Settings

When a clade is selected, the [_branch_](../tree-settings/adjusting-branch-settings) and the [_labels formatting_](../tree-settings/modifying-labels-appearance/changing-labels-formatting) settings are applied to the clade only.

Note that the settings are not applied to the [_collapsed_](collapsing-and-expanding-branches) branches (if any).

See an example of changing branch settings for a clade:
