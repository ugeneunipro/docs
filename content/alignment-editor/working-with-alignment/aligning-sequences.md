# Aligning Sequences

The _Alignment Editor_ integrates several popular multiple sequence alignment algorithms. Below is a list of available algorithms and links to their documentation:

*   Port of the popular [_MUSCLE3_](../../extensions/umuscle/muscle-aligning) algorithm.
*   KAlign plugin: effective for working with large alignments.
*   ClustalW and MAFFT: These algorithms appeared in version 1.7.2 of UGENE with the [_External Tools_](external-tools-plugin.md) plugin.
*   T-Coffee: This alignment algorithm has been available since version 1.8.1 of UGENE with the _External Tools_ plugin.
*   ClustalO: Clustal Omega is the latest addition to the Clustal family. It offers a significant increase in scalability over previous versions, allowing hundreds of thousands of sequences to be aligned in only a few hours.

To align sequences, choose a preferred alignment method in the _Actions_ main menu, in the context menu, or by using the _Align_ main toolbar button.
