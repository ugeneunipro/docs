# Pasting Element

You can paste [_workflow elements_](../introduction/workflow-elements-and-connections) that have been [_cut_](cutting-element) or [_copied_](copying-element).

To do this, choose the _Paste_ item in the _Actions_ main menu or in the [_Scene_](../introduction/workflow-designer-window-components) context menu.

Alternatively, use the Ctrl+V hotkey to paste the elements.
