# Chromatogram Viewer

The _Chromatogram Viewer_ plugin adds DNA chromatogram data viewing and editing capabilities to UGENE.

Currently, the supported chromatogram file formats are ABIF and SCF.

To view a chromatogram, simply open a relevant file in UGENE using standard methods (e.g., drag & drop the file or press the Ctrl-O shortcut). The _Chromatogram Viewer_ is automatically embedded into the generic _Sequence View_ if chromatogram data are detected, as shown in the screenshot below:

After zooming in, more chromatogram details are available:

To edit sequence data, right-click on the chromatogram view and select the _Edit new sequence_ option in the context menu that appears. The following dialog will appear:

Select the new document format and location and click on the _Create_ button.

The original DNA sequence cannot be changed; however, you can add and modify a new sequence stored in a separate file.

The sequence being edited is displayed right above the original one. Symbols can be changed by clicking on an interesting value, and modifications are shown in bold.

Additionally, you can show or hide different signals of the chromatogram and quality bars with the help of the _Show/hide trace_ and _Show quality bars_ toolbar buttons correspondingly:
