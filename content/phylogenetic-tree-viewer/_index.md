# Phylogenetic Tree Viewer

The _Phylogenetic Tree Viewer_ is intended to display a phylogenetic tree built from an alignment or loaded from a file (e.g. a Newick file).

By default, a phylogenetic tree is synchronized with the corresponding alignment.

To disable/enable synchronization use the _Tree and Alignment synchronization_ button. ![](/images/65929722/69402651.png)

To load a tree from a file follow the instruction described in the [_Opening Document_](opening-document.md) paragraph or use the _Tree settings_ tab of the _Options Panel_. For example, you may open the $UGENE\\data\\samples\\Newick\\COI.nwk sample file provided within UGENE package.

To build a tree from a multiple sequence alignment see the [_Building Phylogenetic Tree_](building-phylogenetic-tree.md) paragraph.

To learn what you can do with a tree using UGENE Phylogenetic Tree Viewer read the documentation below.
