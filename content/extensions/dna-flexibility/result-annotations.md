# Result Annotations

Each annotation has the following qualifiers:

* _area\_average\_threshold_ — average window threshold in the area (i.e., _total\_threshold_ / _windows\_number_)
* _total\_threshold_ — sum of all window thresholds in the area
* _windows\_number_ — number of windows in the area
