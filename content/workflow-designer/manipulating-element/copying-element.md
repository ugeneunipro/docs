# Copying Element

To copy one or several [_workflow elements_](workflow-elements-and-connections.md) select them on the [_Scene_](workflow-designer-window-components.md). Note, that you can hold the Ctrl key to select several elements. Then choose the _Copy_ item in the _Actions_ main menu or in a selected element context menu.

The Ctrl+C hotkey is also available for this action.

Now you can [_paste_](pasting-element.md) these elements somewhere on the Scene.
