[{"body":"About the Query Designer The Query Designer allows a molecular biologist to analyze a nucleotide sequence using different algorithms (Repeats finder, ORF finder, Weight matrix matching, etc.) while imposing constraints on the positional relationship of the results obtained from these algorithms.\nA user-friendly interface is used to create a schema of the algorithms and constraints.\nAlternatively, you can create or edit a schema using a text editor.\nOnce the schema has been created and all its parameters set, you can run it on a nucleotide sequence. The results are saved as a set of annotations in the specified file in the Genbank format.

Set the value of the Align short reads method parameter to BWA. The dialog looks as follows:\nThere are the following parameters:\nReference sequence — DNA sequence to align short reads to. This parameter is required.\nResult file name — file in SAM format to write the result of the alignment into. This parameter is required.\nLibrary — single-end or paired-end reads.\nPrebuilt index — check this box to use an index file instead of a source reference sequence. You can also build it manually.\nSAM output — the output file is always saved in the SAM format (the option is disabled for BWA).\nShort reads — each added short read is a small DNA sequence file. At least one read should be added.\nYou can also configure other parameters. They are the same as in the original BWA (you can read a detailed description of the parameters on the BWA manual page). Select one of the following parameters, which correspond to the -n option in the original BWA.\nMax #diff (-n) — maximum edit distance. An integer value should be input.\nMissing prob (-n) — the fraction of missing alignments given a 2% uniform base error rate. A float value is used.\nSeed length (-l) — take the subsequence of the specified length as seed. If the specified length is larger than the query sequence, seeding will be disabled. For long reads, this option is typically ranged from 25 to 35.\nMax gap opens (-o) — maximum number of gap opens.\nIndex algorithm (-a) — algorithm for constructing BWA index.\nIt implements three different algorithms:\nis — designed for short reads up to ~200bp with a low error rate (\u003c3%). It does gapped global alignment with respect to reads, supports paired-end reads, and is one of the fastest short-read alignment algorithms to date while also visiting suboptimal hits. bwtsw — designed for long reads with more errors. It performs heuristic Smith-Waterman-like alignment to find high-scoring local hits. The algorithm is implemented in BWA-SW. On low-error short queries, BWA-SW is slower and less accurate than the is algorithm, but on long reads, it is better. div — does not work for long genomes. Best hits (-R) — proceed with suboptimal alignments if there are no more than a specified number of equally best hits. This option only affects paired-end mapping. Increasing this threshold helps to improve the pairing accuracy at the cost of speed, especially for short reads (~32bp).\nLong-scaled gap penalty for long deletion (-L) — long-scaled gap penalty for long deletion.\nNon-iterative mode (-N) — disable iterative search. All hits with no more than Max #diff differences will be found. This mode is much slower than the default.\nYou can also configure the following advanced parameters:\nEnable long gaps — checking this box allows one to set the Max gap extensions parameter.\nMax gap extensions (-e) — maximum number of gap extensions.\nIndel offset (-i) — disallow insertions and deletions within the specified number of base pairs towards the ends.\nMax long deletion extensions (-d) — disallow long deletions within the specified number of base pairs towards the 3’-end.\nMax queue entries (-m) — maximum queue entries.\nBarcode length (-B) — length of barcode starting from the 5’-end. When the specified length is positive, the barcode of each read will be trimmed before mapping and will be written at the BC SAM tag. For paired-end reads, the barcode from both ends is concatenated.\nThreads (-t) — number of threads.\nMax seed differences (-k) — maximum edit distance in the seed.\nMismatch penalty (-M) — BWA will not search for suboptimal hits with a score lower than the specified value.\nGap open penalty (-O) — gap open penalty.\nGap extension penalty (-E) — gap extension penalty.\nQuality threshold (-q) — parameter for read trimming.\nSelect the required parameters and press the Start button.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Aligning Short Reads with BWA When you select the Tools ‣ DNA Assembly …","ref":"/extensions/bwa/aligning-short-reads-with-bwa/","tags":"","title":"Aligning Short Reads with BWA"},{"body":"Aligning Short Reads with BWA-MEM When you select the Tools ‣ Align to reference ‣ Align short reads item in the main menu, the Align Sequencing Reads dialog appears.

Number of threads (-t) — number of threads.\nMin seed length (-k) — minimum seed length. Matches shorter than INT will be missed. The alignment speed is usually insensitive to this value unless it significantly deviates from 20.\nBand width (-w) — band width. Essentially, gaps longer than INT will not be found. Note that the maximum gap length is also affected by the scoring matrix and the hit length, not solely determined by this option.\nDropoff (-d) — off-diagonal X-dropoff (Z-dropoff). Stop extension when the difference between the best and the current extension score is above |i-j|*A+INT, where i and j are the current positions of the query and reference, respectively, and A is the matching score. Z-dropoff is similar to BLAST’s X-dropoff except that it doesn’t penalize gaps in one of the sequences in the alignment. Z-dropoff not only avoids unnecessary extension but also reduces poor alignments inside a long good alignment.\nInternal seeds length (-r) — trigger reseeding for a MEM longer than minSeedLen*FLOAT. This is a key heuristic parameter for tuning performance. A larger value yields fewer seeds, which leads to faster alignment speed but lower accuracy.\nSkip seeds threshold (-c) — discard a MEM if it occurs more than INT times in the genome. This is an insensitive parameter.\nDrop chain threshold (-D) — drop chains shorter than a FLOAT fraction of the longest overlapping chain.\nRounds of mate rescues (-m) — perform at most INT rounds of mate rescues for each read.\nSkip mate rescue (-S) — skip mate rescue.\nSkip pairing (-P) — in paired-end mode, perform SW to rescue missing hits only but do not try to find hits that fit a proper pair.\nScore for a match (-A) — matching score.\nMismatch penalty (-B) — mismatch penalty. The sequence error rate is approximately: {.75 * exp[-log(4) * B/A]}.\nGap open penalty (-O) — gap open penalty.\nGap extension penalty (-E) — gap extension penalty. A gap of length k costs O + k*E (i.e. Gap open penalty is for opening a zero-length gap).\nPenalty for clipping (-L) — clipping penalty. When performing SW extension, BWA-MEM keeps track of the best score reaching the end of the query. If this score is larger than the best SW score minus the clipping penalty, clipping will not be applied. Note that in this case, the SAM AS tag reports the best SW score; the clipping penalty is not deducted.\nPenalty unpaired (-U) — penalty for an unpaired read pair. BWA-MEM scores an unpaired read pair as scoreRead1+scoreRead2-INT and scores a paired read as scoreRead1+scoreRead2-insertPenalty. It compares these two scores to determine whether pairing should be forced.\nScore threshold (-T) — don’t output alignment with a score lower than the score threshold.

This parameter is required.\nResult file name — file in SAM format to write the result of the alignment into. This parameter is required.\nLibrary — single-end or paired-end reads.\nPrebuilt index — check this box to use an index file instead of a source reference sequence. The index is a set of 6 files with suffixes .1.ebwt, .2.ebwt, .3.ebwt, .4.ebwt, .rev.1.ebwt, and .rev.2.ebwt. The index is created during the alignment. You can also build it manually.\nSAM output — always save the output file in the SAM format (this option is disabled for Bowtie).\nShort reads — each added short read is a small DNA sequence file. At least one read should be added.\nYou can also configure other parameters. They are the same as in the original Bowtie 2 (you can read a detailed description of the parameters on the Bowtie 2 manual page).\nSelect one of the following alignment modes:\nThe –end-to-end alignment mode:\nBy default, Bowtie 2 performs end-to-end read alignment. That is, it searches for alignments involving all of the read characters. This is also called an “untrimmed” or “unclipped” alignment.\nWhen the –local option is specified:\nBowtie 2 performs local read alignment. In this mode, Bowtie 2 might “trim” or “clip” some read characters from one or both ends of the alignment if doing so maximizes the alignment score.\nThe following parameters are available:\nNumber of mismatches (–N) — sets the number of mismatches allowed in a seed alignment during multiseed alignment. Can be set to 0 or 1. Setting this higher makes alignment slower (often much slower) but increases sensitivity.\nSeed length (–L) — sets the length of the seed substrings to align during multiseed alignment. Smaller values make alignment slower but more sensitive.\nAdd columns to allow gaps (–dpad) — “pads” dynamic programming problems by \u003cint\u003e columns on either side to allow gaps.\nDisallow gaps (–gbar) — disallow gaps within \u003cint\u003e positions of the beginning or end of the read.\nSeed (–seed) — use \u003cint\u003e as the seed for the pseudo-random number generator.\nThe following flags are available:\nNo unpaired alignments (–no-mixed) — by default, when bowtie2 cannot find a concordant or discordant alignment for a pair, it then tries to find alignments for the individual mates. This option disables that behavior.\nNo discordant alignments (–no-discordant) — by default, bowtie2 looks for discordant alignments if it cannot find any concordant alignments. A discordant alignment is an alignment where both mates align uniquely, but that does not satisfy the paired-end constraints. This option disables that behavior.\nNo forward orientation (–nofw) — if --nofw is specified, bowtie2 will not attempt to align unpaired reads to the forward (Watson) reference strand.\nNo reverse-complement orientation (–norc) — if --norc is specified, bowtie2 will not attempt to align unpaired reads against the reverse-complement (Crick) reference strand.\nNo overlapping mates (–no-overlap) — if one mate alignment overlaps the other at all, it is considered non-concordant.\nNo mates containing one another (–no-contain) — if one mate alignment contains the other, it is considered non-concordant.\nSelect the required parameters and press the Start button.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Bowtie 2: Aligning Short Reads When you select the Tools ‣ Align to …","ref":"/extensions/bowtie-2/bowtie-2-aligning-short-reads/","tags":"","title":"Bowtie 2 Aligning Short Reads"},{"body":"Bowtie Aligning Short Reads When you select the Tools ‣ DNA Assembly ‣ Align short reads item in the main menu, the Align Short Reads dialog appears.

At least one read should be added.\nThe short reads length for Bowtie cannot be more than 1024.\nYou can also configure other parameters. They are the same as in the original Bowtie (you can read a detailed description of the parameters on the Bowtie manual page).\nSelect one of the following alignment modes:\nThe -n alignment mode:\nWhen the -n mode is selected, Bowtie determines which alignments are valid according to the following policy. Alignments may have no more than N mismatches (where N is a number between 0 and 3) in the first L bases (where L is a number 5 or greater, set with Seed length) on the high-quality (left) end of the read. The sum of the Phred quality values at all mismatched positions (not just in the seed) may not exceed E (set with Maq error). Where qualities are unavailable (e.g. if the reads are from a FASTA file), the Phred quality defaults to 40.\nThe -v alignment mode:\nIn -v mode, alignments may have no more than V mismatches, where V may be a number from 0 through 3. Quality values are ignored. The -v mode is mutually exclusive with the -n mode.\nThe following parameters are available:\nMaq error (–maqerr) — maximum permitted total of quality values at all mismatched read positions throughout the entire alignment, not just in the “seed”. The default is 70. By default, Bowtie rounds quality values to the nearest 10 and saturates at 30. Note that the rounding can be disabled with No Maq rounding.\nSeed Length (–seedlen) — the number of bases on the high-quality end of the read to which the -n applies. The lowest permitted setting is 5 and the default is 28.\nMaximum of backtracks (-maxbts) — the maximum number of backtracks (default: 125 without Best, 800 with Best). A “backtrack” is the introduction of a speculative substitution into the alignment.\nDescriptors memory usage (–chunkmbs) — the number of megabytes of memory a given thread is allocated to store path descriptors in the Best flag. Default: 64. This parameter is available if the Best flag is checked.\nSeed (–seed) — pseudo-random number generator.\nThe following flags are available:\nNo Maq rounding (–nomaqround) — Maq (Mapping and Assembly with Quality) accepts quality values in the Phred quality scale but internally rounds values to the nearest 10, with a maximum of 30. By default, Bowtie also rounds this way. No Maq rounding prevents this rounding in Bowtie.\nNo forward orientation (–nofw) — do not attempt to align against the forward reference strand.\nNo reverse-complement orientation (–norc) — do not attempt to align against the reverse-complement reference strand.\nTry as hard (–tryhard) — try as hard as possible to find valid alignments when they exist, including paired-end alignments.\nBest alignments (–best) — make Bowtie guarantee that reported singleton alignments are “best” in terms of stratum (i.e. number of mismatches, or mismatches in the seed for the case of -n mode) and in terms of the quality values at the mismatched position(s).\nAll alignments (–all) — report all valid alignments per read or pair. The validity of alignments is determined by the alignment policy (combined effects of -n mode, -v mode, Seed length, and Maq error).\nSelect the required parameters and press the Start button.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Bowtie Aligning Short Reads When you select the Tools ‣ DNA Assembly ‣ …","ref":"/extensions/bowtie/bowtie-aligning-short-reads/","tags":"","title":"Bowtie Aligning Short Reads"},{"body":"Build Frequency Matrix Element This component constructs a frequency matrix.

It has two work modes: build index and align short reads (default mode). If there is no index available for the reference sequence, it will be built on the fly.\nUsage: ugene –genome-aligner { –option[=argument] }\nThe following options are available:\n--build-index Use this flag to only build the index for the reference sequence. --reference Path to reference genome sequence --short-reads Path to short reads data in FASTA or FASTQ format --index Path to prebuilt index (base file name or with .idx extension). If not set, the index is searched in the system temporary directory. If –build-index option is applied, the index will be saved to the specified path. --result Path to output alignment in UGENEDB or SAM format (see –sam) --memsize Memory size (in MBs) reserved for short reads. The bigger the value, the faster the algorithm works. Default value depends on available system memory. --ref-size Index fragmentation size (in MBs). Small fragments better fit into RAM, allowing loading more short reads. Default value is 10. --n-mis Absolute amount of allowed mismatches per every short read (mutually exclusive with –pt-mis). Default value is 0. --pt-mis Percentage amount of allowed mismatches per every short read (mutually exclusive with –n-mis). Default value is 0. --rev-comp Use both the read and its reverse complement during the aligning. --best Report only the best alignments (in terms of mismatches). --omit-size Omit reads with qualities lower than the specified value. Reads which have no qualities are not omitted. Default value is 0. --sam Output aligned reads in SAM format. Default value is false. For example:\nBuild index for the reference sequence:\nugene --genome-aligner --build-index --reference=/path/to/ref Align short reads using the existing index:\nugene --genome-aligner --reference=/path/to/ref --short-reads=/path/to/reads --result=/path/to/result ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"CLI Options --help | -h [\u003coption_name\u003e | \u003ctask_name\u003e]\nShows help …","ref":"/ugene-command-line-interface/cli-options/","tags":"","title":"CLI Options"},{"body":"Configuring Dialog Settings In the dialog, you can set up the corresponding parameters:\nWindow size — the number of bases in a window.

Let’s look at the example: We have a sequence with two annotations. The annotations have different lengths and do not intersect each other. The length of annotation 2 is four times that of annotation 1 (41 vs. 11 bases).\nUsing this function, we can find an annotation that intersects both source annotations and captures their parts depending on their lengths. For example, let us find an intersection 25 bases long. We will have the following annotation:\nAs we can see, the intersection with the first annotation is two characters long, and the intersection with the second annotation is eight characters long. This result was chosen because the second annotation is four times the length of the first annotation.\nNOTE: A good candidate for this feature could be any file in GenBank format with a rich set of annotations. FASTA is not the best option because this format does not store annotations.\nParameters The following parameters are available:\nLeft window - annotations to search intersection regions for. Right window - the list of possible intersection regions. Region size - the length of the new intersection region. Result strand - select the DNA strand whose annotations will be considered in the search. If, for example, the “Complement” strand is selected, but all chosen annotations are on the direct strand, then nothing will be found. Annotation must fit into region - all annotations chosen at the left window must fit completely into the result annotation (not just in a few characters). Save regions as annotations - store results as annotations. Clear results - clear the result table.

The input data may also contain annotations associated with the sequences. The workflow reads text strings (patterns) from the input text files. The data are multiplexed using the Multiplexer element. A “1 to many” multiplexing rule is used, so each input sequence is concatenated with each pattern. The results are sent to the Find Substrings element. The Find Substrings element searches for the specified patterns in each sequence. The Grouper merges annotations from the input with those found by the Find Substrings element. Grouping is done by sequence ID. The merged data are saved to the output file (e.g., substrings.gb).

This parameter is mandatory.\nReads — a set of files in *.ab1 or *.scf format with the Sanger sequencing data to be mapped to the reference sequence. At least one read must be added. The read orientation (forward or reverse) will be automatically detected during the mapping.\nDuring the execution of the mapping task, these data are processed as follows: Firstly, to enhance further mapping sensitivity, the low-quality ends of the reads are trimmed off. Then, the reads are mapped using UGENE’s original method, which works in two steps: rough mapping of a read using BLAST+, followed by enhancement of the read alignment with the Smith-Waterman algorithm. After that, the percentage similarity of the two sequences is calculated, which is the number of all edit operations (i.e., insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to transform a read sequence into the corresponding region of the reference sequence. Reads with low similarity to the reference sequence are filtered out.\nThe following parameters of the mapping task can be configured:\nTrimming quality threshold — all bases at the ends of the reads with quality lower than the specified value are trimmed. To skip trimming, set this value to zero.\nMapping min similarity — all reads mapped to the reference with a lower percentage similarity than the specified value are filtered out.\nRead name in result alignment — reads in the resulting alignment can be named either by the names of the sequences in the input files or by the input file names. Set this value to “File name”. For example, if the sequences in the input *.ab1 files have the same name, this will help distinguish the reads in the resulting alignment.\nThe resulting alignment is stored in a native UGENEDB format. You can set up the file location and name in the Result alignment field.

Then, each sequence is marked with either the “Good” mark or the “Rest” mark, depending on the number of annotations in the sequence. After marking, the sequences are filtered by the marks. Finally, the filtered sequences are written into files specified by the user.\nBy default, a sequence with 1 or more annotations is marked as “Good.” You can configure this value in the Sequence Marker element parameters. It is also possible to set up the annotation names that should be taken into account.\nHow to Use This Sample\nIf you haven’t used the workflow samples in UGENE before, look at the “How to Use Sample Workflows” section of the documentation.\nWorkflow Sample Location The workflow sample “Marking Sequences by Annotation Number” can be found in the “Data Marking” section of the Workflow Designer samples.\nWorkflow Image The workflow looks as follows:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Marking by Annotation Number This sample describes how to identify …","ref":"/workflow-designer/workflow-samples/data-marking/marking-by-annotation-number/","tags":"","title":"Marking by Annotation Number"},{"body":"Melting Temperature There are two algorithms for melting temperature calculation:\nRough Primer 3 Note that Rough works only for the DNA alphabet; it does not work for extended DNA and RNA alphabets. Primer3 works for all extended alphabets.\nRough The melting temperature is calculated as follows. For sequences of length 15 or longer:\nTm = 64.9 + 41 * (nG + nC - 16.4) / (nA + nT + nG + nC)\nFor shorter sequences:\nTm = (nA + nT) * 2 + (nG + nC) * 4\nHere “nA”, “nT”, “nC”, and “nG” denote the number of the corresponding nucleotide.\nPrimer 3 This calculation algorithm is borrowed from the Primer3 package. The algorithm uses the nearest-neighbor (NN) model or the formula from Bolton and McCarthy, PNAS 84:1390 (1962) (as presented in Sambrook, Fritsch, and Maniatis, Molecular Cloning, p 11.46, 1989, CSHL Press). The algorithm has the following parameters:\nDNA concentration (nanomolar): A value to use as the nanomolar concentration of each annealing oligo during the PCR. This parameter corresponds to ‘c’ in equation (ii) of the paper [SantaLucia (1998) A unified view of polymer, dumbbell, and oligonucleotide DNA nearest-neighbor thermodynamics. Proc Natl Acad Sci 95:1460-1465 http://www.pnas.org/content/95/4/1460.full.pdf+html], where a suitable value (for a lower initial concentration of template) is “empirically determined.”\nMonovalent concentration (millimolar): The millimolar concentration of monovalent salt cations (usually KCl) in the PCR.\nDivalent concentration (millimolar): The millimolar concentration of divalent salt cations (usually MgCl₂) in the PCR.\nDNTP concentration (millimolar): The millimolar concentration of the sum of all deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. A reaction mix containing 0.2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM CTP, 0.2 mM GTP, and 0.2 mM TTP would have this value equal to 0.8.\nDMSO concentration (%): The concentration of DMSO in percent.\nDMSO factor: The melting temperature of primers can be approximately corrected for DMSO:\nTm = Tm(without DMSO) + DMSO factor * DMSO concentration\nFormamide concentration (mol/l): The concentration of formamide in mol/l. The melting temperature of primers can be approximately corrected for formamide:\nTm = Tm(without formamide) + (0.453 * GC% / 100 - 2.88) * Formamide concentration\nNN Max Length: The maximum sequence length for using the nearest-neighbor model. For sequences longer than this, the algorithm uses the “GC%” formula from Bolton and McCarthy, PNAS 84:1390 (1962):\nTm = 81.5 - DMSO concentration * DMSO factor + 0.453 * (GC% - 2.88) * Formamide concentration + 16.6 * log10(Monovalent concentration / 1000) + 0.41 * GC% - 600 / Length\nThermodynamic table: Specifies the thermodynamic table for the melting temperature calculation:\nBreslauer: Method for Tm calculations from the paper [Rychlik W, Spencer WJ, and Rhoads RE (1990) “Optimization of the annealing temperature for DNA amplification in vitro”, Nucleic Acids Res 18:6409-12 https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/18/21/6409/2388653?login=false] and the thermodynamic parameters from the paper [Breslauer KJ, Frank R, Blocker H, and Marky LA(1986) “Predicting DNA duplex stability from the base sequence” Proc Natl Acad Sci 83:4746-50 http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.83.11.3746] SantaLucia: Method for Tm calculations and the thermodynamic parameters from [SantaLucia JR (1998) “A unified view of polymer, dumbbell, and oligonucleotide DNA nearest-neighbor thermodynamics”, Proc Natl Acad Sci 95:1460-65 http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.4.1460] Salt Correction Formula: Specifies the salt correction formula for the melting temperature calculation:\nSchildkraut: [Schildkraut, C, and Lifson, S(1965) “Dependence of the melting temperature of DNA on salt concentration”, Biopolymers 3:195-208 (not available online)] SantaLucia: [SantaLucia JR(1998) “A unified view of polymer, dumbbell, and oligonucleotide DNA nearest-neighbor thermodynamics”, Proc Natl Acad Sci 95:1460-65 http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.4.1460] Owczarzy: [Owczarzy, R., Moreira, B.G., You, Y., Behlke, M.A., and Walder, J.A.

It can be used by advanced UGENE users to provide a tool for their colleagues.\nBelow, the preparatory configuration steps for the second option are described.\nCreate an XML Configuration File for a Custom External Tool Create an XML file with the custom external tool description. The file should match the following XML schema:\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\u003e \u003cxs:schema xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"ugeneExternalToolConfig\"\u003e \u003cxs:complexType\u003e \u003cxs:sequence\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"name\" type=\"xs:string\"/\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"id\" type=\"xs:string\"/\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"executableName\" type=\"xs:string\"/\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"executableFullPath\" type=\"xs:string\" minOccurs=\"0\"/\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"description\" type=\"xs:string\" minOccurs=\"0\"/\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"version\" type=\"xs:string\" minOccurs=\"0\"/\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"launcherId\" type=\"xs:string\" minOccurs=\"0\"/\u003e \u003cxs:element name=\"dependencies\" type=\"xs:string\" minOccurs=\"0\"/\u003e \u003c/xs:sequence\u003e \u003cxs:attribute name=\"version\" type=\"xs:string\" use=\"required\"/\u003e \u003c/xs:complexType\u003e \u003c/xs:element\u003e \u003c/xs:schema\u003e These XML elements have the following meanings:\nname - the external tool name as it should be displayed in the UGENE GUI. This XML element is mandatory. id - the unique identifier of the external tool. The following characters are allowed: letters (‘A’-‘Z’), digits (‘0’-‘9’), ‘_’, ‘-’. This XML element is mandatory. executableName - the name of the tool executable file (including the file extension, if present). This XML element is mandatory. executableFullPath - a full path to the external tool executable. This XML element is optional. If the “executableFullPath” value is not specified, UGENE searches for a file with the specified “executableName” in the same folder as the XML config file and sets the tool path accordingly. One can also specify either an absolute path to a file or a path relative to the XML config. The path is displayed near the tool in the “Application Settings” dialog. It can also be manually set up by a user. description - a detailed description of the external tool. This XML element is optional. version - a version of the tool executable. This XML element is optional. launcherId - if the tool is supposed to be run with a script interpreter or is a Java application, this element should contain an appropriate ID. Currently, UGENE supports the following launcher IDs: USUPP_PYTHON2, USUPP_PERL, USUPP_RSCRIPT, USUPP_JAVA. If the launcher is specified, it will be added to the launch command whenever you try to run the external tool. The path to the launcher will be taken from the “Application Settings” (see the corresponding tools in the “Supported Tools” group). If the element is not specified or is empty, no additional launcher will be added to the command that runs the tool. This XML element is optional. dependencies - a comma-separated list of other external tool IDs the new tool depends on. If the dependency is not satisfied, the dependent tool is marked as “not valid” in UGENE. This XML element is optional.

The tool can inform UGENE that it should be launched by Perl, so UGENE will add a path to Perl to the command that runs the tool. The XML config also specifies an absolute full path to the executable file.\nPrepare a Package with the XML Configuration File, the Tool Executable, and Optionally, Other Files The easiest way to “pack” the custom external tool is to:\nCreate a new folder with all files required to run the tool. Specify a relative path in the XML configuration file as described above. Put the XML configuration file into the same folder as the main tool executable.

This means that the consensus will only contain characters that are the same in all sequences of the alignment. Decreasing the threshold will result in considering only the specified percentage of the sequences. For example, if the threshold is 80% and 82% of the sequences have “A” at a certain column position, the consensus will also contain “A” at this position.\nAlternatively, you may select another algorithm to calculate the consensus. The algorithm proposed by Victor Levitsky uses the extended DNA alphabet. The greater the threshold value selected for this algorithm, the more rare characters are taken into account. The specified value must be between 50% and 100%.\nFinally, there is a “Keep gaps” parameter that specifies whether the resulting sequence must contain gaps or whether they should be skipped. By default, gaps are kept in the resulting consensus sequence.\nHow to Use This Sample If you haven’t used the workflow samples in UGENE before, refer to the How to Use Sample Workflows section of the documentation.\nWorkflow Sample Location The sample “Extract Consensus as Sequence” can be found in the “Alignment” section of the Workflow Designer samples.\nWorkflow Image The opened workflow looks as follows:\nWorkflow Wizard The wizard has 3 pages:\n1.

Additionally, it is possible to merge data from other slots associated with the specified one.\nElement type: grouper\nParameters To use the Grouper element, connect the Grouper’s input port to the required workflow element. Select the Grouper element on the Scene and specify Group slot and Group operation parameters in the Parameters area in the Property Editor. To merge associated data, it is possible to create as many Output slot(s) as required (see details below).\nGroup slot The Group slot specifies a slot that is used to group the input data. The list of available values for the parameter depends on the slots of workflow elements which produce data in the workflow before the Grouper element. There is a special Unset value. When it is selected, only one group is created.\nGroup operation The Group operation specifies criteria to group data supplied to the Group slot. It can take the following values:\nBy value - input data are compared by value (a group is created for each unique value, it can contain one or several identical values). By identity - input data are compared by internal data ID (all values are unique). By name - input data are compared by their names. By value group operation is available for group slots of types Sequence, Set of annotations, MSA, Plain text, Source URL. By identity and By name group operations are available for group slots of type Sequence only.\nOutput slots When data supplied to the Group slot are divided into different groups, the associated data are also grouped. The possible associated data depend on the workflow. For example, a Sequence Reader element contains slots Sequence and Set of annotations. These data are associated as annotations belong to a sequence. Another example of associated data are sequence markers created by the Sequence Marker element. The associated data can, therefore, be additionally handled (i.e., merged) by the Grouper element. The action that can be performed on the associated data depends on their type. In any case, to output handled associated data, you need to create a new output slot in the Grouper element. To create it, click the Add button in the Grouper’s Parameters area. The following dialog appears:\nIn the dialog, you should select a Source data slot (i.e., a slot with the associated data) and input a name of the new slot. Click the OK button. A new dialog appears that specifies how the associated data should be merged.

Also, you can shift annotations. To do it, you need to create another output slot with type Sequence and Merge into one sequence option selected (see below). In other words, you need to merge all sequences in a group into one sequence. In this case, you select the corresponding sequence slot in the New Annotations Action dialog, and each set of annotations in a group is shifted according to the corresponding sequence in the group. As a result, you have one sequence and one set of annotations allocated on the whole sequence.\nFor Source URL and Plain text slots, the New String Action dialog appears: Using this dialog, you can merge strings into one string. Optionally, you can specify an additional strings separator.\nFor a Sequence slot, the New Sequence Action dialog appears: You can either merge all sequences in a group into one sequence or create a multiple sequence alignment. In the first case, you need to specify the Merged sequence name, and you can select the number of unknown characters between the merged sequences. In the second case, you need to specify the alignment name. To filter duplicated sequences, check the corresponding checkbox.\nFor a MSA slot, the New Alignment Action dialog appears: Input the alignment name in this dialog.

This parameter is required. Result file name — file in UGENE database format or SAM format (if the box SAM output is checked), to write the result of the alignment into. This parameter is required. Prebuilt index — check this box to use an index file instead of a reference sequence. You can also build it manually. SAM output — checking this box allows output files to be saved in the SAM format. The default format of output files is the UGENE database format (ugenedb). Short reads — each added short read is a small DNA sequence file. At least one read should be added. The Map NGS Reads with UGENE Genome Aligner has no limitation on short read length.\nCommon parameters:\nMismatches allowed — check this box to allow mismatches between the reference sequence and a short read. Select one of the following: Mismatches number to set the number of mismatched nucleotides allowed. This parameter can take values of 1, 2, or 3. Percentage of mismatches to set the number of mismatches in percent. Note that in this case, the absolute number of mismatches can vary for different reads. This parameter can take values from 1% - 10%. Align options:\nUse GPU-optimization — use an OpenCL-enabled GPU during the alignment (the corresponding hardware should be available on your computer).

Use “best”-mode during the alignment — report only about the best alignments (in terms of mismatches). Omit reads with qualities lower than — omit all reads with qualities lower than the specified value. Reads that have no qualities are not omitted. Advanced parameters:\nMaximum memory for short reads — maximum memory usage for short reads. This parameter allows one to decrease the load on the computer on one side and to increase the speed of the task on the other side. Total memory usage — shows the total memory usage. System memory size — shows the total system memory size. Index parameters:\nReference fragmentation — this parameter influences the number of parts the reference will be divided into. It’s better to make it larger, but it influences the amount of memory used during the alignment. Index memory usage size — shows the index memory usage. Directory for index files — temporary directory for saving index files. You can choose a temporary directory for saving index files for the reference that will be built during the alignment.

Select one of the following:\nequal — no rate variation across sites. gamma — gamma-distributed rates across sites. The rate at a site is drawn from a gamma distribution. The gamma distribution has a single parameter that describes how much rates vary. propinv — a proportion of the sites are invariable. invgamma — a proportion of the sites are invariable while the rate for the remaining sites is drawn from a gamma distribution. Gamma — sets the number of rate categories for the gamma distribution.\nYou can select the following parameters for the MCMC analysis:\nChain length — sets the number of cycles for the MCMC algorithm. This should be a large number as you want the chain to first reach stationarity and then remain there for enough time to take many samples.\nSubsampling frequency — specifies how often the Markov chain is sampled. You can sample the chain every cycle, but this results in very large output files.\nBurn-in length — determines the number of samples that will be discarded when convergence diagnostics are calculated.\nHeated chains — specifies the number of chains used in Metropolis coupling. Set to 1 to use the usual MCMC analysis.\nHeated chain temp — the temperature parameter for heating the chains. The higher the temperature, the more likely the heated chains are to move between isolated peaks in the posterior distribution.\nRandom seed — a seed for the random number generator.\nDisplay tree in new window — displays the tree in a new window.\nDisplay tree with alignment editor — displays the tree with the alignment editor.\nSynchronize alignment with tree — synchronizes the alignment and tree.\nSave tree to — specifies the file to save the built tree.\nPress the Build button to run the analysis with the selected parameters and build a consensus tree.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"MrBayes The Building Phylogenetic Tree dialog for the MrBayes method …","ref":"/alignment-editor/building-phylogenetic-tree/mrbayes/","tags":"","title":"MrBayes"},{"body":"Multiplexer Element This element allows you to join two data flows into a single data flow, i.e., to merge messages from two input ports into concatenated messages and send them to the output. The concatenation approach is determined by the Multiplexing rule parameter.\nThere are the following multiplexing rules:\n1 to 1 1 to many Rule: 1 to 1 This rule means that the multiplexer takes one message from the first input port and one message from the second input port, combines them into a single message, and transfers it to the output. This procedure is repeated while there are available messages in both input ports.\nSee an example workflow below:\nAs you can see:\nThere are elements A, B, C, and the Multiplexer. A and B are data readers. A receives three data objects as input. These objects are denoted as I, II, and III. A has two slots; the input data objects may also contain various data. For example, these may include “Sequence” and “Set of annotations” slots, with data read from three GenBank files. B receives two data objects as input. These objects are denoted as IV and V. B also has two slots in this example. C gets messages in the workflow from B. It has one output slot. For example, this may be a “Set of annotations” slot, i.e., additional annotations were calculated for input objects IV and V. Now, in the Multiplexer element, we have three messages from A, corresponding to the three input objects I, II, and III. We also have two messages from B and C elements, corresponding to the two input objects IV and V with additional information calculated in C. The multiplexing rule is “1 to 1”, meaning we only consider messages that have a pair. Thus, “Message 3” is ignored in this case. However, the multiplexer concatenates the other messages. “Message 1” is concatenated with “Message 6”, producing “Message 8”. “Message 2” is concatenated with “Message 7”, producing “Message 9”. Rule: 1 to many This rule means that the multiplexer takes one message from the first input port, joins it with each message from the second input port, and transfers the joined messages to the output. This procedure is repeated for each message from the first input port.\nSee an example workflow below:\nAs you can see, the conditions are the same as in the first “1 to 1” case described above:\nAs in the first image, there are elements A, B, C, and the Multiplexer. A and B are data readers. A receives three data objects as input. These objects are denoted as I, II, and III. A has two slots. B receives two data objects as input. These objects are denoted as IV and V. B has two slots. C gets messages in the workflow from B. It has one output slot. The Multiplexer element receives three messages from A and two messages from C. However, the multiplexing is done such that each message from A is concatenated with each message from C. As a result, the following messages are produced:\nMessage Combination Resulting Message “Message 1” + “Message 6” “Message 8” “Message 1” + “Message 7” “Message 9” “Message 2” + “Message 6” “Message 10” “Message 2” + “Message 7” “Message 11” “Message 3” + “Message 6” “Message 12” “Message 3” + “Message 7” “Message 13” Element type: multiplexer\nParameters Parameter Description Default value Parameter in Workflow File Type Multiplexing rule Available values are: 1 to 1, 1 to many.

There are several ways to obtain the cDNA for a corresponding DNA sequence.\nFrom NCBI or ENSEMBL databases.\nFor example, one can download the TMPRSS2 transcript variant 1 from NCBI Genbank using identifier NM_001135099.1. This can also be done from UGENE using the option Access remote database or Search NCBI Genbank.\nAlign the genomic and cDNA sequences using a spliced aligner. For this option, one must have both genomic and cDNA sequences. In UGENE, the spliced alignment can be performed using the Spidey tool. To run the alignment, open the genomic sequence and select the action Align ‣ Align to mRNA sequence. The generated exon annotations can then be exported using the action Export ‣ Export sequence of selected annotations.\nTo design primers for your mRNA sequence, go to the RT-PCR tab of the Primer Designer dialog:\nThe following parameters are available:\nExon annotation name\nTo detect exon boundaries, UGENE searches for exonic annotations. This option allows setting a custom name for annotations denoting exons. The default value is “exon.”\nMinimum exon junction overlap size\nIf checked, then only the pairs with at least one of the primers overlapping the exon junction in the mRNA sequence will be selected.\nAt 5’ side (bp)\nMinimum overlap size on the 5’ side of the exon junction. The default is 5 bp.\nAt 3’ side (bp)\nMinimum overlap size on the 3’ side of the exon junction. The default is 5 bp.\nExon range\nThis option allows limiting the sequence region where the primers are searched for. For example, setting the value “3-5” will limit the search to a sequence region consisting of exons 3, 4, and 5 of the transcript, as defined by the order in the sequence. The default value is an empty string, which means that there are no limitations.\nSpan at least one intron\nThis option ensures that the primer product spans an intron on the genomic sequence, i.e., the forward and reverse primers must be located in different exons. The option is enabled by default.\nMax number of pairs to query\nThe algorithm applied in RT-PCR primer design first searches for all available primers in a given sequence. Then it filters the detected pairs to make sure that they satisfy the selected configuration. This option allows setting the maximum number of pairs for the initial search query. A larger number will result in increased sensitivity but also in a longer running time.

It consists of workflow elements and their connections.\nWorkflow Element\nAn element of a workflow. Different elements are used to read data from files on disk, perform some algorithms, and write data to files on disk. Each element contains one or several input and output ports.\nElement Connection\nA connection between two elements specifies that data in the output port of one element should be passed to a matching input port of another element.\nInput Port\nAn input port of an element is used to collect data from another element. A workflow element may have several input ports. On the Scene, such a port is displayed as a right semicircle.\nOutput Port\nAn output port of an element is used to provide data to another element. A workflow element may have one output port or none. On the Scene, the port is displayed as a left semicircle.\nSlot\nEach port has one or several slots. A slot is the smallest passageway to transfer the workflow data through. It has a specific type (e.g., “Sequence”, “Set of annotations”, etc.). For example, only sequence data can be passed through a sequence slot.\nThus, an input port has one or several input slots. These slots specify data that are expected as input by the element. An output port has one or several output slots. These slots specify the data that the element produces.\nIn a workflow, an element usually has access to slots of the connected elements located earlier in the workflow.\nMessage\nA message is a single data chunk, transferred from an output slot of one element to an input slot of another element.

Read the chapter Manipulating Element to learn what else you can do with workflow elements.\nIf you have two elements with matching output and input ports, you can make the connection by dragging the arrow between the ports:\nAll matching ports of available processes are highlighted while you drag the arrow, and the arrow sticks to a near match as you drag closer. If an element has a single matching port, you can simply drop the arrow on the element itself to create a correct connection.\nOnce created, a connection will follow the movements of the linked elements; you cannot redirect or reshape the connection arrow but only remove it. You can move the port around the element to which it belongs by dragging it while holding the Alt key. This is helpful for fine-tuning the visual layout of a workflow.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Workflow Elements and Connections The Scene is initially empty, and …","ref":"/workflow-designer/introduction/workflow-elements-and-connections/","tags":"","title":"Workflow Elements and Connections"},{"body":"Working with Clade This paragraph describes how to select a clade and modify its appearance.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Working with Clade This paragraph describes how to select a clade and …","ref":"/phylogenetic-tree-viewer/working-with-clade/","tags":"","title":"Working with Clade"},{"body":"Write FASTA Element This element receives message(s) with sequence data and saves the data to the specified file(s) in FASTA format.\nElement type: write-fasta\nParameters Parameter Description Default Value Parameter in Workflow File Type Output file Location of the output data file.

Thus, the colors may vary in this case from those described below.\nColoring Schemes for Nucleotides The following scheme options are available for nucleotide alignment:\nNo colors — Do not color the residues’ background (i.e., all residues have a white background and black font).\nJalview — Use the following background colors: A - green, C - orange, G - red, T/U - blue. Gaps and characters of the extended nucleotide alphabet are not colored.\nPercentage identity — A residue’s background color depends on its presence in the column of the alignment: \u003c=40% - white, 41-60% - light slate blue, 61-80% - medium slate blue, 81-100% - dark slate blue.\nPercentage identity (colored) — Colors depend on the residues’ percentage presence in a column. The following rules are applied (in the order of priority):\nIf all residues (100%) are the same and there are no gaps, the residues in the column have a yellow background and red font. If there are 50% of one residue in the column and 50% of another (gaps are not taken into account), one-half of the residues has a green background and black font (the half to be colored is determined based on the following priorities: T\u003eU\u003eG\u003eC\u003eA\u003eB\u003eD\u003eH\u003eK\u003eM\u003eR\u003eS\u003eV\u003eW\u003eY\u003eN). If there is one or several residues in a column with a percentage number equal to or greater than the threshold parameter (see the Threshold parameter on the Highlighting tab of the Options Panel), then the most frequent residues are colored as follows: light blue background color and blue font. Note that gaps are taken into account when calculating the percentage number in the column in this case. Also, if required, the same residues’ priorities are applied as in the previous rule. If the rules above are not applied for a residue, then it remains uncolored, i.e., white background color and black font are used. Percentage identity (gray) — This coloring scheme is similar to the Percentage identity scheme, but shades of gray are used instead of slate blue.\nUGENE — This is the default coloring scheme; the following background colors are used: A - yellow, C - light green, G - light blue, T/U - light red, gap - white. Other colors may be used for characters of the extended nucleotide alphabet.\nUGENE Sanger — This coloring scheme is used in the UGENE Sanger Reads Editor; the background colors correspond to the peaks of Sanger chromatogram peaks: A - green, C - blue, G - light gray, T - red. The orange background color is used for a gap, and the magenta background color is used for characters of the extended nucleotide alphabet.\nWeak Similarities — When there is a choice between two characters and it is not specified by other rules which character to color, the following priorities apply: T\u003eU\u003eG\u003eC\u003eA\u003eB\u003eD\u003eH\u003eK\u003eM\u003eR\u003eS\u003eV\u003eW\u003eY\u003eN.\nColoring rules:\nDo not color gaps (“-”), i.e., use a black font and white background. Residues should be colored according to their percentage number in the column (use the priorities described above in case of equal percentage numbers). Residues with the most frequency/priority in the column. A custom scheme can be created and used with colors that depend on a residue.\nColoring Schemes for Amino Acids The following scheme options are available for amino acid alignment:\nNo colors — Do not color the residues’ background (i.e., all residues have a white background and black font). Buried index — Depending on the frequency of occurrence inside a globule, the amino acid residues are colored from light green (less frequent) to blue (most frequent). Clustal X — An emulation of the default color scheme in Clustal X, a graphical interface for the ClustalW multiple alignment programs. Helix propensity — Depending on helix propensity, the residues are colored from magenta (the highest helix propensity) to green (the lowest one). Hydrophobicity — Residues are colored based on their hydrophobicity. The most hydrophobic residues are red, and the most hydrophilic are blue. Percentage identity — A residue’s background color depends on its presence in the column of the alignment: \u003c=40% - white, 41-60% - light slate blue, 61-80% - medium slate blue, 81-100% - dark slate blue. Percentage identity (gray) — This coloring scheme is similar to the Percentage identity scheme, but shades of gray are used instead of slate blue. Strand propensity — Residues with the highest strand propensity are yellow, while those with the lowest are blue. Tailor — See this publication by William R.Taylor. Turn propensity — Residues with the highest turn propensity are red, while those with the lowest are cyan. UGENE — This is the default coloring scheme; the following background colors are used for the residues: positive (KRH) - yellow, aromatic (FWY) - green, large aliphatic hydrophobic (ILM) - blue, small hydrophobic (ST) - rose, GP - red, EX - gray. Zappo — Amino acids residues are colored according to their physicochemical properties: aliphatic/hydrophobic (residues ILVAM) - rose, aromatic (FWY) - orange, positive (KRH) - dark blue, negative (DE) - red, hydrophilic (STNQ) - light green, conformationally special (PG) - magenta, cysteine (C) - yellow.

Mutations\nMutations are differences between sequences. On the graphic, they are represented by gaps in diagonal lines. These gaps interrupt matches.\nb. Insertions\nInsertions are parts of one sequence that are missing in another, while the surrounding parts match. In other words, an insertion is a subsequence that was inserted into a sequence.\nGraphically, insertions are represented by gaps that lie only on one axis. A slight shift towards the other axis indicates a mutation is involved.\nc. Deletions\nA deletion is a subsequence that has been removed from a sequence.\nA deletion from sequence A, found in sequence B, can be considered an insertion into sequence B when contained in sequence A.\n3.

Inverted repeats are shown as opposed to direct repeats.\nUse the Search direct repeats and Search inverted repeats options in the Dotplot parameters dialog to select which repeats to depict (the dialog is described here).\n4.

If a region is not selected, the whole sequence will be analyzed.\nThe following dialog will appear where you can choose the search options:\nGeneral options are:\nSelect the search type — In the remote databases, the blastn search is used for nucleotide sequences, while blastp and cdd searches are used for amino acid sequences. UGENE also provides a way to use blastp and cdd searches for nucleotide sequences. This is achieved by translating the nucleotide sequence into amino acid sequences.\nWhen a sequence is translated, the translation table from the active Sequence View is used. Finally, all six translations are used to query the remote database with the selected blastp or cdd search.\nExpectation value — This option specifies the statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences. Lower expect thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported.\nMax hits — The maximum number of hits that will be shown (not equal to the number of annotations). The maximum available number is 5000.\nDatabase — The target database.\nSearch for short, nearly exact matches — Automatically adjusts the word size and other parameters to improve results for short queries.\nMegablast — Select this option to compare the query with closely related sequences. It works best if the target percent identity is 95% or more, but it is very fast.\nYou can see the description of the annotation saving parameters here.\nSearch timeout — The remote task is terminated if the timeout is reached. There is a slight difference in default values of parameters between the NCBI Nucleotide BLAST web interface and UGENE:\nThe web interface uses the megablast option by default: the search is fast but only finds highly similar sequences. UGENE ignores the option by default: the search may take more time, but it finds all somewhat similar sequences. Check the Megablast option if you want exactly the same results to be found in UGENE as you had in the NCBI web interface.\nThere is also an Advanced options tab:\nThe view of the Advanced options tab depends on the selected search. For the blastn search, it looks like the picture above.\nWord size — The size of the subsequence parameter for the initiated search.\nGap costs — Costs to create and extend a gap in an alignment. Increasing the gap costs will result in alignments that decrease the number of gaps introduced.\nMatch scores — Reward and penalty for matching and mismatching bases.\nEntrez query — A BLAST search can be limited to the result of an Entrez query against the chosen database. This restricts the search to a subset of entries from that database fitting the requirement of the Entrez query. Examples are given below:\nprotease NOT hiv1[organism] — This will limit a BLAST search to all proteases, except those in HIV 1. 1000:2000[slen] — This limits the search to entries with lengths between 1000 to 2000 bases for nucleotide entries or 1000 to 2000 residues for protein entries. Mus musculus[organism] AND biomol_mrna[properties] — This limits the search to mouse mRNA entries in the database. For common organisms, one can also select from the pulldown menu. 10000:100000[mlwt] — This is yet another example usage, which limits the search to protein sequences with calculated molecular weights between 10 kD to 100 kD. src specimen voucher[properties] — This limits the search to entries that are annotated with a /specimen_voucher qualifier on the source feature. all[filter] NOT environmental sample[filter] NOT metagenomes[orgn] — This excludes sequences from metagenome studies and uncultured sequences from anonymous environmental sample studies. For help in constructing Entrez queries, see the Entrez Help document.\nFilters — Filters for regions of low compositional complexity and repeat elements of the human genome.\nMasks for lookup table only — This option masks only for purposes of constructing the lookup table used by BLAST so that no hits are found based upon low-complexity sequences or repeats (if repeat filter is checked).\nMask lower case letters — With this option selected, you can cut and paste a FASTA sequence in uppercase characters and denote areas you would like filtered with lowercase.\nFilter by — Filters results by accession, by definition of annotations, or by id.\nSelect result by — Selects results by EValue or by score.\nWhen the blastp search is selected in the general options, the view of the Advanced options tab is as follows:\nAs you can see, there is no Match scores option, but there are Matrix and Service options.\nMatrix — A key element in evaluating the quality of a pair-wise sequence alignment is the “substitution matrix”, which assigns a score for aligning any possible pair of residues.\nService — The blastp service which needs to be performed: plain, psi, or phi.\nThe Advanced options tab is not available when the cdd search is selected.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Remote BLAST The Remote BLAST plugin provides the capability to …","ref":"/extensions/remote-blast/","tags":"","title":"Remote BLAST"},{"body":"Removing All Columns of Gaps Use the Shift+Del shortcut or Edit ‣ Remove all columns of gaps option in the Actions main menu or in the context menu to remove all columns of gaps from the alignment.

It produces several output files that contain test results for changes in expression at the levels of transcripts, primary transcripts, and genes. It also tracks changes in the relative abundance of transcripts sharing a common transcription start site and the relative abundances of the primary transcripts of each gene. Tracking the former allows one to observe changes in splicing, while the latter lets one see changes in relative promoter use within a gene.\nElement type: cuffdiff\nParameters Parameter Description Default value Parameter in Workflow File Type Output directory Directory to save MACS output files. out-dir string Time series analysis If set to True, instructs Cuffdiff to analyze the provided samples as a time series, rather than testing for differences between all pairs of samples. Samples should be provided in increasing time order. False time-series-analysis boolean Upper quartile norm If set to True, normalizes by the upper quartile of the number of fragments mapping to individual loci instead of the total number of sequenced fragments. This can improve the robustness of differential expression calls for less abundant genes and transcripts. False upper-quartile-norm boolean Hits norm Instructs how to count all fragments. ‘Total’ specifies to count all fragments, including those not compatible with any reference transcript, towards the number of mapped fragments used in the FPKM denominator. ‘Compatible’ specifies to use only compatible fragments. Selecting ‘Compatible’ is generally recommended in Cuffdiff to reduce certain types of bias caused by differential amounts of ribosomal reads, which can create the impression of falsely differentially expressed genes. Compatible hits-norm numeric Frag bias correct Providing the sequences your reads were mapped to instructs Cuffdiff to run a bias detection and correction algorithm, which can significantly improve the accuracy of transcript abundance estimates. frag-bias-correct string Multi read correct Do an initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads mapping to multiple locations in the genome. False multi-read-correct boolean Library type Specifies RNA-Seq protocol. Standard Illumina library-type numeric Mask file Ignore all reads that could have come from transcripts in this file. It is recommended to include any annotated rRNA, mitochondrial transcripts, or other abundant transcripts you wish to ignore in your analysis in this file. Due to variable efficiency of mRNA enrichment methods and rRNA depletion kits, masking these transcripts often improves the overall robustness of transcript abundance estimates. mask-file numeric Min alignment count The minimum number of alignments in a locus needed to conduct significance testing on changes observed in that locus between samples.

There are different methods to calculate the consensus, and each method reveals unique biological properties of the aligned sequences. The Alignment Editor allows switching between different consensus modes. To switch the consensus mode, go to the General tab of the Options Panel, activate the context menu (using the right mouse button), or use the Actions menu and select the Consensus mode item. The General tab will open automatically:\nThere are several consensus modes:\nDefault — The mode is based on the JalView algorithm. A character in the consensus is calculated based on the characters in the corresponding column and the value of the threshold:\nIf the percentage value of the most frequent character is greater than the threshold, the character is shown in uppercase in the consensus. If there are two characters with the equal highest frequency in a column, the ‘+’ sign is shown. If the percentage value of the most frequent character is high but lower than the specified threshold, the character is shown in lowercase in the consensus. ClustalW — Emulates the ClustalW program behavior.\nIf the percentage value of the most frequent character is equal to 100%, the ‘*’ base is shown in the consensus. Otherwise, no characters are shown. Levitsky (not for AMINO alignment) — Proposed by Victor Levitsky, this mode calculates the consensus of a DNA alignment, taking into account the frequencies of characters in the whole alignment, not just one column. The algorithm includes these steps:\nCollect global alignment frequencies for every character in alignment using the extended DNA alphabet. For example, the A base increments the counter of the following bases: A (the base itself), W (A or T), R (A or G), M (A or C), V (A or C or G), H (A or C or T), D (A or G or T), N (A or C or G or T). Check the frequency of each symbol in the column: If the frequency percentage value is greater than the threshold, this base is considered a consensus symbol - see further algorithm description. If the frequency percentage value is lower than the specified threshold, this base is not considered a consensus symbol. From the set of bases not filtered in point 2, choose the rarest characters in the whole alignment (global frequencies have been calculated in point 1): If there is only one base, this character is shown in the consensus. If there are two or more bases, these symbols should be joined into one common base. For example, if there are two bases A and T, they will be joined into an extended DNA alphabet base W. Check this table for all possible combinations. Simple extended (not for AMINO alignment) — A character of the consensus is calculated based on the characters in the corresponding column. This algorithm joins all bases in the column (but only those with a frequency percentage value greater than the threshold) into a single base from the DNA extended alphabet using this table.\nStrict — If a character’s percentage in a column is higher than the specified threshold, the character is shown in the consensus at this position. Otherwise, a gap character (‘—’) is shown.\nAlso, the General tab shows general information about an alignment and allows one to set up a reference sequence.

When a region is selected in the sequence, the statistics are interactively recalculated for this region only.

Use the copy item in the context menu or a shortcut - Ctrl+C on Windows or Linux, Cmd+C on macOS.\nNucleotide sequence common statistics The following common statistical information is calculated for a nucleotide sequence:\nLength GC content Molecular weight Extinction coefficient Melting temperature nmole/OD260 μg/OD260 GC content The percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases within the sequence or its selected region, for example:\nGC-content(“ACGTAC”) = ((0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1) / 6) * 100% = 50%\nIf the sequence contains degenerate base characters, average values are used, for example:\nGC-content(“ACGNBCT”) = ((0 + 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 2/3 + 1 + 0) / 7) * 100% ≈ 59.52%\nIn this example, “1/2” is used for “N” (any nucleotide), “2/3” is used for “B” (which means “C”, “G”, or “T” according to the IUPAC nucleotide code).\nMolecular weight Molecular weight for a single-stranded molecule is calculated as a sum of the atomic masses of the molecule’s components:\nDNA molecular weight = nA*251.24 + nT*242.23 + nC*227.22 + nG*267.24 + (n-1)*61.97\nRNA molecular weight = nA*267.24 + nU*244.20 + nC*243.22 + nG*283.24 + (n-1)*61.97\nHere “nA”, “nT”, “nC”, “nG”, “nU” denote the number of the corresponding nucleotide in the molecule, and “n” is the number of all bases (61.97 is the weight of an internal phosphate).\nFor degenerate base characters, the average value of nucleotide weight is used. For example, if the sequence also contains “Y” characters (which are “C” or “T”), the sum will include one more term - “nY*(242.23 + 227.22)/2”.\nMolecular weight for a double-stranded molecule is calculated as the sum of the single strands’ molecular weights.\nTo calculate the Extinction coefficient, an approach proposed by Richard Owczarzy is used: http://www.owczarzy.net/extinctionDNA.htm. For a single-stranded molecule:\nExtinction coefficient = sum(extinction coefficients of all dinucleotides) - sum(extinction coefficients of inner mononucleotides)\nFor example, let’s calculate the molar extinction coefficient (“ε”) for “ATGCA”:\nε(ATGCA) = ε(AT) + ε(TG) + ε(GC) + ε(CA) - ε(T) - ε(G) - ε(C)\n= 22800 + 19000 + 17600 + 21200 - 8700 - 11500 - 7400\n= 53000\nAs with the other statistics, average values are used in the case of degenerate base characters.\nThe Extinction coefficient for a double-stranded molecule is calculated as a sum of the extinction coefficients of the two single strands (es1 + es2) multiplied by a coefficient of (1 - hypochromicity h260nm). The hypochromicity effect can be accounted for as follows:\nh260nm = (0.287fAT + 0.059fGC)\nwhere _f_AT and _f_GC are fractions of AT and GC base pairs, respectively.\nMelting temperature Click on the gear icon near the Melting temperature label, and the Melting temperature settings dialog will open.

It utilizes Bowtie or Bowtie2 to map the reads and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons.\nProvide URL(s) to FASTA or FASTQ file(s) with NGS RNA-Seq reads to the input port of the element, set up the reference sequence in the parameters. The result is saved to the specified BAM file, and the URL to the file is passed to the output port. Several UCSC BED tracks are also produced: junctions, insertions, and deletions.\nElement type: tophat\nParameters Parameter Description Default value Parameter in Workflow File Type Reference input type Select “Sequence” to input a reference genome as a sequence file. Note that any sequence file format supported by UGENE is allowed (FASTA, GenBank, etc.). The index will be generated automatically in this case. Select “Index” to input already generated index files, specific for the tool. Index reference-input-type string Bowtie index folder The folder with the Bowtie index for the reference sequence. bowtie-index-dir string Bowtie index basename The basename of the Bowtie index for the reference sequence. bowtie-index-basename string Output folder The base name of the output folder.

False no-novel-junctions boolean Raw junctions The list of raw junctions. raw-junctions string Known transcript file A set of gene model annotations and/or known transcripts. known-transcript string Max multihits Instructs TopHat to allow up to this many alignments to the reference for a given read, and suppresses all alignments for reads with more than this many alignments. 20 max-multihits numeric Segment length Each read is cut up into segments, each at least this long. These segments are mapped independently. 25 segment-length numeric Fusion search Turn on fusion mapping. False fusion-search boolean Transcriptome only Only align the reads to the transcriptome and report only those mappings as genomic mappings. False transcriptome-only boolean Transcriptome max hits Maximum number of mappings allowed for a read, when aligned to the transcriptome (any reads found with more than this number of mappings will be discarded). 60 transcriptome-max-hits numeric Prefilter multihits When mapping reads on the transcriptome, some repetitive or low complexity reads that would be discarded in the context of the genome may appear to align to the transcript sequences and thus may end up reported as mapped to those genes only. This option directs TopHat to first align the reads to the whole genome in order to determine and exclude such multi-mapped reads (according to the value of the Max multihits option). False prefilter-multihits boolean Min anchor length The anchor length. TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction. Note that individual spliced alignments may span a junction with fewer than this many bases on one side. However, every junction involved in spliced alignments is supported by at least one read with this many bases on each side. 8 min-anchor-length numeric Splice mismatches The maximum number of mismatches that may appear in the anchor region of a spliced alignment. 0 splice-mismatches numeric Read mismatches Final read alignments having more than these many mismatches are discarded. 2 read-mismatches numeric Segment mismatches Read segments are mapped independently, allowing up to this many mismatches in each segment alignment. 2 segment-mismatches numeric Solexa 1.3 quals As of the Illumina GA pipeline version 1.3, quality scores are encoded in Phred-scaled base-64.

To learn more about the UGENE CLI and the available commands, read the main UGENE User Manual.\nThis chapter describes how you can create a new command using a workflow.\nTo run a workflow from the command line, do the following:\nCreate the workflow in the Workflow Designer. For example, in the image below, the Align sequences with MUSCLE sample workflow is used: Now you should configure aliases for those parameters, ports, and slots that you are going to use from the command line. To do this, select the Actions ‣ Set parameter aliases… item in the main menu or click the Set parameter aliases toolbar button. The following dialog appears: It contains the list of objects that correspond to the elements of the workflow. For each object, a list of parameters is available for which you can assign command-line aliases. For example, assign the alias in to the parameter Input file (of the Read alignment element):\nAnd assign the alias out to the parameter Output file (of the Write Stockholm element).\nTo select ports and slots aliases, use the following dialog by the Actions-\u003eConfigure port and slot aliases main menu item:\nPress the Ok button to save aliases and close the dialog. When you create aliases, you can import the workflow to an element using the Actions-\u003eImport workflow to element main menu item.\nSave the workflow to a file: If you follow the example, choose the Actions ‣ Save workflow as… item in the main menu, browse for the file location, and enter mySchema as the workflow name. This name will be used to launch the workflow from the command line. Launch the workflow from the command line: [path_to_ugene]ugene --task={schema_name} [--{parameter1}={value1} [--{parameter2}={value2} ...]] The run information will be saved into the text file. By default, it is in the working directory.\nFor example, on Windows, the command can look as follows:\nugene --task=C:\\mySchema --in=C:\\COI.aln --out=C:\\COI.sto In this example, the path to the directory with the UGENE executable is added to the system PATH variable.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Running Workflow from the Command Line UGENE provides a command-line …","ref":"/workflow-designer/running-workflow-from-the-command-line/","tags":"","title":"Running Workflow from the Command Line"},{"body":"Sanger Reads Editor Open the Tools ‣ Sanger data analysis submenu from the main menu.\nSelect the Map reads to reference menu item.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Sanger Reads Editor Open the Tools ‣ Sanger data analysis submenu from …","ref":"/sanger-reads-editor/","tags":"","title":"Sanger Reads Editor"},{"body":"Sanger Reads Settings Some mutations may have a chromatogram signal weaker than the reference one. This situation often arises when analyzing a mix of cells (healthy and oncological). This means that the mutation signal could vary due to the different concentration of oncological cells in a sample.\nLook at the picture below. The signal of the “C” nucleotide (blue) is the highest. However, there is also a signal for the “T” nucleotide (red), which is significant. The second strongest signal is what we call an Alternative mutation.\nIt is very important to make Alternative mutations clearly visible. To accomplish this, you can use the function of the Alternative mutation. When this function is enabled and an alternative mutation meets the settings, the corresponding character will be replaced with the alternative one. This replacement causes a difference between the read and the reference character, meaning the read character will be highlighted:\nThe settings for Alternative mutations are presented in the following picture:\nShow alternative mutations – Enable Alternative mutations to display them if checked; otherwise, disable and hide them.\nThreshold – Determines how strong the second strongest signal (relative to the first strongest signal) should be to be visible.

The main objective of the Assembly Browser is to enable users to visualize and efficiently navigate large next-generation sequence assemblies.\nCurrently supported formats are SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and BAM, which is the binary version of the SAM format. Both formats are produced by SAMtools and are described in the following specification: SAMtools. Support for other formats is also planned, so please send us a request if you are interested in a particular format.\nTo browse assembly data in UGENE, a BAM or SAM file should be imported into a UGENE database file. After that, you can convert the UGENE database file into a SAM file. Importing to a UGENE database file has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages include the potential time required for importing a large file and the need for sufficient disk space to store the database file.\nOn the other hand, this allows users to overview the entire assembly and navigate through it relatively quickly. Additionally, during the import process, you can select specific contigs to be imported from the BAM/SAM file. Thus, there is no need to import the entire file if you plan to work only with certain contigs. Note that in the future, there are plans to support an alternative approach, specifically when a BAM/SAM file is opened directly.\nThe Assembly Browser has been tested on various BAM/SAM files from the 1000 Genomes Project as well as from other sources.\nRead the documentation below to learn more about the features of the Assembly Browser.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Assembly Browser The UGENE Assembly Browser project, which began in …","ref":"/assembly-browser/","tags":"","title":"Assembly Browser"},{"body":"Assembly Browser Hotkeys ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Assembly Browser Hotkeys ","ref":"/assembly-browser/assembly-browser-hotkeys/","tags":"","title":"Assembly Browser Hotkeys"},{"body":"Building Dotplot for Currently Opened Sequence To build a dotplot for the currently opened sequences, create a multiple view containing these sequences.

The following options are available:\nAVGQUAL: Drop the read if the average quality is below the specified level. CROP: Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP: Cut adapter and other Illumina-specific sequences from the read. LEADING: Remove bases off the start of a read if below a threshold quality. MAXINFO: Perform an adaptive quality trim. MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length. SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64. TRAILING: Remove bases off the end of a read if below a threshold quality. Each step has its own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases regardless of quality from the end of the read so that the read has at most the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might, of course, further shorten the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step is used to find and remove Illumina adapters. Trimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match enough, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines), and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are now available by default. The naming of the various sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections that will still allow a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12 base sequence will score just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore, the threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases), Trimmomatic is still able to identify very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog. To call the dialog, press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold, the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See the Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length that is likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases; however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favours read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be placed after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor-quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step re-encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step re-encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold, the base is removed and the next base (i.e. the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used for removing special Illumina “low-quality segment” regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base.

To search for multiple patterns, input the patterns separated by a new line in the pattern text field. To add a new line symbol, Ctrl+Enter may be used. You can input the value as a sequence or the name of the sequence in the FASTA format, and the sequence follows after that. Press the Next button to search in the direction “From left to right.” Press the Previous button to search in the direction “From right to left.” If the pattern is found, the result will be focused and highlighted in the Sequence area. You can continue the search in any direction from this position.\nBy default, misc_feature annotations are created for regions that exactly match the pattern. Below is the description of the available settings.\nLoad Patterns from File Use this option to load patterns from a file. When this option is active, the Search for field is disabled.\nSearch Algorithm This group specifies the algorithm that should be used to search for a pattern. The algorithm can be one of the following:\nInsDel — There could be insertions and/or deletions, i.e., a pattern and the searched region can vary in their length. You can specify the percentage of the pattern and a searched region match in the nearby field. Note that this value also depends on the pattern length and is disabled when the pattern hasn’t been specified.\nSubstitute — A pattern may contain characters different from the characters in the searched region. When this algorithm has been selected, you can also specify the match percentage, and it is possible to take into account ambiguous bases.\nRegular expression — A regular expression may be specified instead of a pattern. For example, the character ‘.’ matches any character, and ‘.*’ matches zero or more of any characters. There is also the Result no longer than option that specifies the maximum length of a result.\nExact - Find a place where one or several patterns are found within a larger pattern.\nSearch in In this group, you can specify where to search for a pattern: in what region and which strand (for nucleotide sequences). Also, for nucleotide sequences, it is possible to search for a pattern on the sequence translations.\nStrand — For nucleotide sequences only. Specifies on which strand to search for a pattern: Direct, Reverse-complementary, or Both strands.\nSearch in — For nucleotide sequences, you can select the Translation value for this option. In this case, the input pattern will be searched for in the amino acid translations.\nRegion — Specifies the sequence range where to search for a pattern. You can search in the whole sequence, specify a custom region, or search in the selected region.\nOther Settings This group contains additional common settings:\nRemove overlapped results — Annotates only one of the overlapped results.\nLimit results number to — Limits the number of the searched results to the specified value.\nAnnotations Settings In the Save annotation(s) to group, you can set up a file to store annotations. It could be either an existing annotation table object or a new annotation table.\nIn the Annotation parameters group, you can specify the name of the group and the name of the annotation. If the group name is set to , UGENE will use the group name as the name for the group. You can use the ‘/’ characters in this field as a group name separator to create subgroups. If the annotation name is set to by type, UGENE will use the annotation type from the Annotation type: table as the name for the annotation. Also, you can add a description in the corresponding text field. To use a pattern name for the annotations, check the corresponding checkbox.\nAfter that, click the Create annotations button. The annotations will be created.\nSearching for one or several patterns and names of the result annotations If you search for one pattern only, input the required name into the Annotation name field and leave the Use pattern name checkbox unchecked.\nYou can also search for several patterns at a time by:\nInputting several patterns into the search field (click + keys to insert a new line): Inputting several patterns into the search field in FASTA format: Loading patterns from a FASTA file\nEven when you search for several patterns, the names of the found annotations will be identical by default (the name is specified in the Annotation name field).\nIf you want to assign different names to annotations found for different patterns, then you should:\nInput the patterns in FASTA format (the latter two cases above).

The following options are available:\nILLUMINACLIP: Cut adapter and other Illumina-specific sequences from the read. SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read if below a threshold quality. TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read if below a threshold quality. CROP: Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. MINLEN: Drop the read if it is below a specified length. AVGQUAL: Drop the read if the average quality is below the specified level. TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64. Each step has its own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases from the end of the read, ensuring it has at most the specified length after this step has been performed.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step finds and removes Illumina adapters.\nTrimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match sufficiently, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See the Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines), and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are available by default. The naming of the sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections that still allows a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12-base sequence scores just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore the threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases), Trimmomatic can identify very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog to set them. To access the dialog, press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning of the read. As long as a base has a value below this threshold, the base is removed and the next base is examined.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See the Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length likely to allow locating the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can fit into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be around 40 bases. However, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible and removing incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favors read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads falling below the specified minimum length. It should normally be placed after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor-quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step re-encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step re-encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end of the read. As long as a base has a value below this threshold, the base is removed and the next base (i.e., the preceding one) is examined. This approach can remove the special Illumina “low-quality segment” regions (marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. To remove a step, use the Remove selected step button. The pink highlighting means a required parameter has not been set.\nKraken settings: Default Kraken parameters can be changed here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nDatabase: A path to the folder with the Kraken database files. Quick operation: Stop classification of an input read after a certain number of hits. This number can be specified in the “Minimum number of hits” parameter. CLARK settings: Default CLARK parameters can be changed here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nDatabase: A folder that should be used to store the database files. K-mer length: This value is critical for classification accuracy and speed. For high sensitivity, it is recommended to set this value to 20 or 21 (along with the “Full” mode). However, if precision and speed are the main concerns, use any value between 26 and 32. Note that the higher the value, the higher the RAM usage. As a good trade-off between speed, precision, and RAM usage, set this value to 31 (along with the “Default” or “Express” mode).\nMinimum k-mer frequency: Minimum k-mer frequency/occurrence for the discriminative k-mers (-t). For example, for 1 (or, 2), the program will discard any discriminative k-mer appearing only once (or, less than twice).\nMode: Set the mode of execution (-m):\n“Full” to get detailed results, confidence scores, and other statistics. “Default” to get a results summary and perform the best trade-off between classification speed, accuracy, and RAM usage. “Express” to get a results summary with the highest speed possible. Sampling factor value\nGap: “Gap” or number of non-overlapping k-mers to pass when creating the database (-п). Increase the value if it’s required to reduce RAM usage. Note that this will degrade sensitivity.\nWEVOTE settings: Default WEVOTE parameters can be changed here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nPenalty: Score penalty for disagreements (-k) Number of agreed tools: Specify the minimum number of tools agreed on for WEVOTE decision (-a).

These primers are typically between 18 and 24 bases in length and must code for only the specific upstream and downstream sites of the sequence being amplified. A primer that can bind to multiple regions along the DNA will amplify them all, eliminating the purpose of PCR.\nA few criteria must be considered when designing a pair of PCR primers. Pairs of primers should have similar melting temperatures since annealing during PCR occurs for both strands simultaneously, and this shared melting temperature must not be too much higher or lower than the reaction’s annealing temperature. A primer with a _T_m (melting temperature) much higher than the reaction’s annealing temperature may mishybridize and extend at an incorrect location along the DNA sequence. A _T_m significantly lower than the annealing temperature may fail to anneal and extend at all.\nAdditionally, primer sequences need to be chosen to uniquely select for a region of DNA, avoiding the possibility of hybridization to a similar nearby sequence.\nThere are other parameters to be taken into account - Gibbs free energy, self- and heterodimers availability, etc. All parameters are described below in detail.\nUGENE provides the “PCR Primer Design for DNA Assembly” feature only for nucleic sequences with the “Standard DNA” alphabet. To use it in UGENE, open a DNA sequence and go to the “PCR Primer Design for DNA Assembly” tab of the Options Panel:\nThe following parameters are available:\nUser primers: The pair of forward and reverse primers can be checked for the absence of unwanted connections (like hairpins, self- and heterodimers). Choose generated sequences as user primers’ end: User primers could be extended with 8-base sequences on the 5’ and 3’ ends. These sequences do not form simple unwanted connections (for example, “AAAATTTT” obviously has a hairpin, so such sequences are not included in the list). Parameters of priming sequences: The range of melting temperature, Gibbs free energy, and length primers should have. Parameters to exclude in whole primers: The minimum melting temperature, maximum Gibbs free energy, and maximum base pair length that may be present in the self- and heterodimers in the considered primer. Select areas for priming search: Select areas to search forward and reverse primers in. Open the backbone sequence: Choose a sequence to be added to the 5’ or 3’ end of the result primer. Other sequences in the PCR reaction: The list of sequences to check for unwanted connections. The unwanted connections should fit the “Parameters to exclude in whole primers”. Designing Primers Physical Quantities The designed primers should have the specified Gibbs free energy, melting temperature, and length. These primers could also have hairpins, self-, and heterodimers, but the mentioned parameters of these found dimers should be limited. See the pictures below:\nThe found primer “GATGGTGATGTTAATGGGCAC” has a Gibbs free energy between -40 and -30 kcal/mol, a melting temperature between 51 and 65 °C, and a length between 18 and 25 nucleotides. Also, there are no hairpins, self-, and heterodimers in this primer, which have Gibbs free energy greater than -7 kcal/mol, melting temperature less than 20 °C, and base pairs length more than 3 nucleotides.\nRegions Forward primers are searched in the left region, while reverse primers are searched in the right region. There is an amplified fragment between them:\nThe left search area is from 1 to 71 bases, and the right search area is from 355 to 426 bases. The amplified fragment is between them.\nBackbone Sequence The backbone sequence is the sequence added to the 5’ end of the primer for the following assembly of the PCR product with the backbone molecule. This parameter is optional. You may set the backbone sequence, the sequence end you want to add the backbone to, and the length of the sequence from the 5’ and 3’ ends to check if these sequences have unwanted hairpins, self-, and heterodimers. The pictures below show the differences between “5’ insert to 5’ backbone” and “5’ insert to 3’ backbone” (“insert” in this case is the same as “primer”).\nIf you set “5’ backbone length,” then the number of bases you set from the 5’ end of the backbone sequence will be checked for unwanted connections. The same applies to “3’ backbone length,” but from the 3’ end. If the checked end has hairpins, self-, and homodimers, you will see the following dialog:\nBackbone details Other Sequences in PCR Reactions Sequences that are supposed to be in the reaction mixture. It is important that primers do not have unwanted connections to these sequences, so it will be checked that there are no hairpins, self-, or heterodimers between the resulting primer and any sequence from the “Other sequences in PCR reaction” file.\nResult The search result is from 1 to 4 pairs of primers. The results should be as close as possible to the amplified fragment. This means that the searching process starts from the edge of the amplified fragment in the 5’ direction on the direct strand for the forward primer and in the 3’ direction on the reverse-complementary strand for the reverse primer. The results are defined with special names:\nA: The pair of primers closest to the amplified fragment, corresponding to the entire set of parameters. B1: The pair of primers closest to the amplified fragment, corresponding to the entire set of parameters if B2 and/or B3 exist. B2: The pair of primers corresponding to the entire set of parameters, which has a 4-nucleotide intersection with B1. B3: The pair of primers corresponding to the entire set of parameters, which starts immediately when B1 ends. You may also see results in the result table. A single click on the result in the result table selects the corresponding annotation, while double-clicking exports the resulting primer to a separate file (with the backbone sequence, which will be added during the exporting process).\nUser Primer You may check the validity of the pair of primers by typing this pair into the corresponding fields. You may also add your primers’ 5’ and/or 3’ 8-base endings, which do not form simple unwanted connections.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"PCR Primer Design for DNA Assembly Overview The polymerase chain …","ref":"/extensions/pcr-primer-design-for-dna-assembly/","tags":"","title":"PCR Primer Design for DNA Assembly"},{"body":"Query Designer ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Query Designer ","ref":"/query-designer/","tags":"","title":"Query Designer"},{"body":"Remove Duplicates in BAM Files Element Remove PCR duplicates from BAM files using SAMTools rmdup.\nElement type: rmdup-bam\nParameters Parameter Description Default Value Parameter in Workflow File Type Output directory Select an output directory.

The following options are available:\nStep Description ILLUMINACLIP Cut adapter and other Illumina-specific sequences from the read. SLIDINGWINDOW Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. LEADING Cut bases off the start of a read if below a threshold quality. TRAILING Cut bases off the end of a read if below a threshold quality. CROP Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. MINLEN Drop the read if it is below a specified length. AVGQUAL Drop the read if the average quality is below the specified level. TOPHRED33 Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64 Convert quality scores to Phred-64. Each step has its own parameters:\nAVGQUAL\nThis step drops a read if the average quality is below the specified level.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum average quality required to keep a read. CROP\nThis step removes bases regardless of quality from the end of the read so that the read has at most the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might further shorten the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read. HEADCROP\nThis step removes the specified number of bases, regardless of quality, from the beginning of the read.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the number of bases to remove from the start of the read. ILLUMINACLIP\nThis step is used to find and remove Illumina adapters.\nTrimmomatic first compares short sections of an adapter and a read. If they match enough, the entire alignment between the read and adapter is scored. For paired-end reads, the “palindrome” approach is also used to improve the result. See the Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nAdapter sequences: a FASTA file with the adapter sequences. Files for TruSeq2 (GAII machines), TruSeq3 (HiSeq and MiSeq machines), and Nextera kits for SE and PE reads are now available by default. The naming of the various sequences within the specified file determines how they are used. Seed mismatches: the maximum mismatch count in short sections which will still allow a full match to be performed. Simple clip threshold: a threshold for simple alignment mode. Values between 7 and 15 are recommended. A perfect match of a 12 base sequence will score just over 7, while 25 bases are needed to score 15. Palindrome clip threshold: a threshold for palindrome alignment mode. For palindromic matches, a longer alignment is possible. Therefore, a threshold can be in the range of 30. Even though this threshold is very high (requiring a match of almost 50 bases), Trimmomatic is still able to identify very short adapter fragments. There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. Use the following dialog. To call the dialog, press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold, the base is removed, and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See the Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length which is likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed into many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases; however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favors read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor-quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold, the base is removed, and the next base (i.e., the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used to remove the special Illumina “low-quality segment” regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. To remove a step, use the Remove selected step button. The pink highlighting means the required parameter has not been set.\nKraken Settings: Default Kraken parameters can be changed here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nParameter Description Database A path to the folder with the Kraken database files. Quick operation Stop classification of an input read after the certain number of hits. The value can be specified in the “Minimum number of hits” parameter. CLARK Settings: Default CLARK parameters can be changed here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nParameter Description Database A folder that should be used to store the database files. K-mer length This value is critical for the classification accuracy and speed. For high sensitivity, it is recommended to set this value to 20 or 21 (along with the “Full” mode). However, if precision and the speed are the main concern, use any value between 26 and 32. Note that the higher the value, the higher is the RAM usage. So, as a good trade-off between speed, precision, and RAM usage, it is recommended to set this value to 31 (along with the “Default” or “Express” mode). Minimum k-mer frequency Minimum of k-mer frequency/occurrence for the discriminative k-mers (-t). For example, for 1 (or 2), the program will discard any discriminative k-mer that appear only once (or, less than twice). Mode Set the mode of the execution (-m): “Full” to get detailed results, confidence scores, and other statistics. “Default” to get results summary and perform the best trade-off between classification speed, accuracy and RAM usage. “Express” to get results summary with the highest speed possible. Sampling factor value Gap “Gap” or number of non-overlapping k-mers to pass when creating the database (-п). Increase the value if it is required to reduce the RAM usage. Note that this will degrade the sensitivity.

There are also two optional parameters for palindrome mode: Min adapter length and Keep both reads. To use the following dialog, press the Optional button.\nLEADING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold, the base is removed, and the next base will be investigated.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. MAXINFO\nThis step performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors. See the Trimmomatic manual for details.\nInput the following values:\nTarget length: the read length likely to allow the location of the read within the target sequence. Extremely short reads, which can be placed in many different locations, provide little value. Typically, the length would be in the order of 40 bases, however, the value also depends on the size and complexity of the target sequence. Strictness: the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs. removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (0.8) favors read correctness. MINLEN\nThis step removes reads that fall below the specified minimum length. If required, it should normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and included in the “dropped reads” count.\nInput the following values:\nLength: the minimum length of reads to be kept. SLIDINGWINDOW\nThis step performs a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor-quality base will not cause the removal of high-quality data later in the read.\nInput the following values:\nWindow size: the number of bases to average across. Quality threshold: the average quality required. TOPHRED33\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 33.\nTOPHRED64\nThis step (re)encodes the quality part of the FASTQ file to base 64.\nTRAILING\nThis step removes low-quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold, the base is removed, and the next base (i.e., the preceding one) will be investigated. This approach can be used for removing the special Illumina “low-quality segment” regions (which are marked with a quality score of 2), but SLIDINGWINDOW or MAXINFO are recommended instead.\nInput the following values:\nQuality threshold: the minimum quality required to keep a base. To remove a step, use the Remove selected step button. The pink highlighting means the required parameter has not been set.\nTopHat settings: TopHat parameters can be set here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nReference genome: Path to the indexed reference genome. Known transcript file: A set of gene model annotations and/or known transcripts. Library type: Specifies RNA-Seq protocol. Read mismatches: Final read alignments having more than these mismatches are discarded. Mate inner distance: The expected (mean) inner distance between mate pairs. Mate standard deviation: The standard deviation for the distribution on inner distances between mate pairs. Min anchor length: The anchor length. TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction. Note that individual spliced alignments may span a junction with fewer than this many bases on one side. However, every junction involved in spliced alignments is supported by at least one read with this many bases on each side. Splice mismatches: The maximum number of mismatches that may appear in the anchor region of a spliced alignment. Max multihits: Instruct TopHat to allow up to this many alignments to the reference for a given read and suppresses all alignments for reads with more than this many alignments. Raw junctions: The list of raw junctions. No novel junctions: Only look for reads across junctions indicated in the supplied GFF or junctions file. This parameter is ignored if Raw junctions or Known transcript file is not set. StringTie settings: StringTie parameters can be set here.\nThe following parameters are available:\nReference annotations: Use the reference annotation file (in GTF or GFF3 format) to guide the assembly process (-G). The output will include expressed reference transcripts as well as any novel transcripts that are assembled. Reads orientation: Select the NGS libraries type: unstranded, stranded fr-secondstrand (–fr), or stranded fr-firststand (–rf). Min assembled transcript length: Specify the minimum length for the predicted transcripts (-m). Min anchor length for junctions: Junctions that don’t have spliced reads that align them with at least this amount of bases on both sides are filtered out (-a). Min junction coverage: There should be at least this many spliced reads that align across a junction (-j). This number can be fractional since some reads align in more than one place. A read that aligns in n places will contribute 1/n to the junction coverage. Trim transcripts based on coverage: By default, StringTie adjusts the predicted transcript’s start and/or stop coordinates based on sudden drops in coverage of the assembled transcript. Set this parameter to “False” to disable the trimming at the ends of the assembled transcripts (-t). Min coverage for assembled transcripts: Specifies the minimum read coverage allowed for the predicted transcripts (-c). A transcript with a lower coverage than this value is not shown in the output. This number can be fractional since some reads align in more than one place. A read that aligns in n places will contribute 1/n to the coverage. Min locus gap separation: Reads that are mapped closer than this distance are merged together in the same processing bundle (-g). Fraction covered by multi-hit reads: Specify the maximum fraction of multiple-location-mapped reads that are allowed to be present at a given locus (-M). A read that aligns in n places will contribute 1/n to the coverage. Skip assembling for sequences: Ignore all read alignments (and thus do not attempt to perform transcript assembly) on the specified reference sequences (-x). The value can be a single reference sequence name (e.g., “chrM”) or a comma-delimited list of sequence names (e.g., “chrM,chrX,chrY”). This can speed up StringTie, especially in the case of excluding the mitochondrial genome, whose genes may have very high coverage in some cases, even though they may be of no interest for a particular RNA-Seq analysis. The reference sequence names are case-sensitive and must match identically the names of chromosomes/contigs of the target genome against which the RNA-Seq reads were initially aligned. Multi-mapping correction: Enables or disables (-u) multi-mapping correction. Verbose log: Enable detailed logging, if required (-v). The messages will be written to the UGENE log (enabling “DETAILS” and “TRACE” logging may be required) and to the dashboard. Label: Use the specified string as the prefix for the name of the output transcripts (-l).

The Smith-Waterman Search dialog appears:\nAlgorithm This search algorithm has a significant advantage in calculation time over the usual Search in sequence algorithm for large sequences. This happens because the “Search in sequence” algorithm represents a suffix algorithm - one sequence moves along the other, and areas opposite each other are compared. Using this approach, the computation time increases in direct proportion to the length of the sequence. The Smith-Waterman algorithm uses a completely different approach - searching using a certain kind of matrix.\nThe algorithm works in the following way:\nA matrix is created where the sequence in which the search is carried out is located vertically, and the searched sequence is located horizontally. Fill the adjacent row and column with 0. Example: The sequence in which the search is carried out - ACGCGAT. The searched sequence - CGCG.\nD(i,j) C G C G 0 0 0 0 0 A 0 C 0 G 0 C 0 G 0 A 0 T 0 Start filling the matrix from the top-left corner, moving from left to right and from top to bottom, using the following formula: Where: D(S1, S2) - current cell, D(S1-1, S2) - the cell on the left, D(S1, S2-1) - the cell above, D(S1-1, S2-1) - the one on the top and left, gap - the Gap open penalty if we encounter a gap for the first time and the Gap extension penalty if we encounter a gap the second time or more. score - the value from the Scoring matrix table. The following example uses nucl Scoring matrix (+5 for match, -4 for mismatch) and -1 for Gap open and Gap extension penalties:\nFind the largest number and move to the top, left, or top-left to the next larger number: Matching green symbols indicate the desired sequence intersection.\nParameters First of all, you need to specify the pattern to search for. The rest of the parameters are optional:\nSearch in — select either to search in the sequence or in its amino acid translation.\nStrand — select the strand to search in: direct, reverse-complementary, or both strands.\nRegion — specifies the region of the sequence that will be used to search for the pattern. By default, if a subsequence has been selected when the dialog has been opened, then the selected subsequence is searched for the pattern. Otherwise, the whole sequence is used. You can also input a custom range.\nAlgorithm version — version of the algorithm implementation. All versions produce the same result - only the inner technology is used differently:\nClassic 2 - classical implementation of the algorithm. Works everywhere. SSE2 - the algorithm, which works much faster, but requires you to have an SSE2 processor. Scoring matrix — can be chosen from a variety of matrices supplied with UGENE. To view a selected matrix, click the View button.\nGap open — penalty for opening a gap.\nGap extension — penalty for extending a gap.\nReport results — simple heuristic which allows filtering of intersected hits. If it is set to none, the algorithm may report a large set of almost identical results in the same region.\nMinimal score — another simple heuristic which measures sequence similarity. It is more convenient than using some abstract scores. If set to 100%, the algorithm will search for an exact substring match.\nInput and output The results of the search are saved as annotations or as multiple alignments. To set the saving parameters, go to the Input and output tab of the dialog.\nIf you want to save the results as annotations, input the annotations saving parameters (Annotation name, Group name, Annotation type, Description and a file to save the annotation to). You can also add a qualifier with corresponding pattern subsequences to result annotations. Check the corresponding checkbox for this.\nIf you want to save the results as multiple alignments, select the following parameters:\nHere you can select a file to save the alignment to (Alignment files directory path parameter).\nUsing the Set advanced options checkbox, you can select the saving options.\nYou can set different templates for file names: create your own or create using the following: [E] — adds a subsequence end position, [hms] — adds a time, [MDY] — adds a date, [S] — adds a subsequence start position, [L] — adds a subsequence length, [SN] — adds a reference sequence name prefix, [PN] — adds a pattern sequence name prefix, [C] — adds a counter.\nYou can create templates for alignment file names, reference subsequence names, pattern subsequence names, and for the pattern sequence name:\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Smith-Waterman Search The Smith-Waterman Search plugin adds a complete …","ref":"/extensions/smith-waterman-search/","tags":"","title":"Smith-Waterman Search"},{"body":"Utils ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Utils ","ref":"/workflow-designer/workflow-elements/utils/","tags":"","title":"Utils"},{"body":"Variation Annotation with SnpEff SnpEff is a tool for variant annotation and effect prediction.

If the adapter sequence starts with the character ‘^’, the adapter is ‘anchored’. An anchored adapter must appear in its entirety at the 5’ end of the read (it is a prefix of the read). A non-anchored adapter may appear partially at the 5’ end or may occur within the read. If it is found within a read, the sequence preceding the adapter is also trimmed.

It is used for both nucleotide and protein sequences. ClustalW is a command-line version of the program.\nClustal homepage: http://www.clustal.org\nIf you are using Windows OS, there are no additional configuration steps required, as the ClustalW executable file is included in the UGENE distribution package. Otherwise:\nInstall the Clustal program on your system. Set the path to the ClustalW executable on the External tools tab of the UGENE Application Settings dialog. Now you are able to use Clustal from UGENE.\nOpen a multiple sequence alignment file and select the Align with ClustalW item in the context menu or in the Actions main menu. The Align with ClustalW dialog appears (see below), where you can adjust the following parameters:\nGap opening penalty — cost of opening up a new gap in the alignment. Increasing this value will make gaps less frequent.\nGap extension penalty — cost of every item in a gap. Increasing this value will make gaps shorter.\nWeight matrix — specifies a single weight matrix for nucleotide sequences or a series of matrices for protein sequences.\nFor nucleotide sequences, the weight matrix selected defines the scores assigned to matches and mismatches (including IUB ambiguity codes), and it can take the following values:\nIUB — default scoring matrix used by BESTFIT for the comparison of nucleic acid sequences. X’s and N’s are treated as matches to any IUB ambiguity symbol. All matches score 1.9; all mismatches for IUB symbols score 0. CLUSTALW — previous system used by ClustalW, in which matches score 1.0 and mismatches score 0. All matches for IUB symbols also score 0. For protein sequences, it describes the similarity of each amino acid to each other. The following values are available:\nBLOSUM — BLOcks of Amino Acid SUbstitution Matrices first introduced in a paper by Henikoff and Henikoff. These matrices appear to be the best available for carrying out database similarity (homology searches). PAM — Point Accepted Mutation matrices introduced by Margaret Dayhoff. These have been extremely widely used since the late ‘70s. GONNET — these matrices were derived using almost the same procedure as the Dayhoff one (above) but are much more up to date and are based on a far larger data set. They appear to be more sensitive than the Dayhoff series. ID — identity matrix which gives a score of 1.0 to two identical amino acids and a score of zero otherwise. Iteration type — specifies the iteration type to use. During the iteration step, each sequence is removed in turn and realigned. It is kept if the resulting alignment is better than the one made before. This process is repeated until the score converges or until the maximum number of iterations is reached. Available values are:\nNONE — specifies not to use iterations. TREE — specifies to iterate at each step of the progressive alignment. ALIGNMENT — specifies to iterate on the final alignment. Max iterations — maximum number of iterations.\nThe following parameters are only available for protein sequences:\nGap separation distance — tries to decrease the chances of gaps being too close to each other. Gaps that are less than this distance apart are penalized more than other gaps. This does not prevent close gaps; it makes them less frequent, promoting a block-like appearance of the alignment.\nHydrophilic gaps off — increases the chances of a gap within a run of hydrophilic amino acids.\nNo end gap separation penalty — treats end gaps just like internal gaps to avoid gaps that are too close.\nResidue-specific gaps off — amino acid-specific gap penalties that reduce or increase the gap opening penalties at each position in the alignment or sequence. For example, positions rich in glycine are more likely to have an adjacent gap than positions rich in valine.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"ClustalW Clustal is a widely used multiple sequence alignment program. …","ref":"/extensions/clustalw/","tags":"","title":"ClustalW"},{"body":"ORF Marker Element Identifies Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in each supplied nucleotide sequence and stores the identified regions as annotations.\nElement type: orf-search\nParameters in GUI Parameter Description Default value Parameter in Workflow File Type Annotate as (required) Name of the result annotations.

The specified value should be more than 15. The difference score of an overlap is the sum of scores at each difference.\nMax qscore sum at differences (-d) — Remove an overlap if its difference score is greater than the specified value. The specified value should be more than 20.\nSimilarity score of an overlap parameters:\nThe following parameters are used to calculate the similarity score of an overlapping alignment:\nMatch score factor (-m) — A match at bases of quality values q1 and q2 is given a score of m * min(q1, q2), where m is the specified value. The specified value should be more than 0.\nMismatch score factor (-n) — A mismatch at bases of quality values q1 and q2 is given a score of n * min(q1, q2), where n is the specified value.

Much like the SITECON, the main use case of the plugin is the recognition of potential transcription factor binding sites based on data about conservative conformational and physicochemical properties revealed through binding site set analysis.\nThe Weight Matrix contains numerous position frequency matrices (PFMs) and position weight matrices (PWMs, also known as position-specific score matrices — PSSMs). These matrices come from two widely-known open archives: JASPAR, which contains frequency matrices, and UniPROBE containing weight matrices.\nAdditionally, the Weight Matrix plugin provides a tool for creating specific position frequency and weight matrices from an existing alignment or from a file with several sequences. The created matrix can be used as a profile for the search, just like the JASPAR and UNIPROBE ones.\nTo search for transcription factor binding sites in a DNA sequence, select the Analyze ‣ Search TFBS with matrices context menu item. The Weight matrix search dialog will appear:\nIn the search dialog, you must specify a file with PWM or PFM. You can do so by pressing the browse button and selecting the file.\nYou can also use the special interface to choose a JASPAR matrix by pressing the Search JASPAR database button.\nAn alternative way to specify the position weight/frequency matrix is to create a specific one from an alignment or a file with several sequences using the build a new matrix tool.\nAfter the profile (the matrix) is loaded, you can adjust the threshold value. The threshold sets the minimal identity score for a result to pass. The higher the result score, the more it is homologously related to the aligned region. By changing the threshold, you can filter low-scoring results.\nIf the loaded matrix is a position frequency matrix, you must also specify the algorithm to build the corresponding position weight matrix, which will represent the transcription factor. There are four algorithms available.\nYou can also add a selected matrix with the specified Minimal score and the Algorithm to the matrices list. To do this, select the matrix and other options and press the Add to queue button. The plugin will search with all matrices specified in the list.\nYou can use the Save list button to export the list of matrices to a *.csv file.

It was developed by M. Zuker in the late 1980s for RNA folding and improved for DNA folding in 1996. mfold uses nearest neighbor energy rules.\nTool home page: mfold.org. Similar results to those produced by UGENE can be obtained using the mfold web server (DNA prediction, RNA prediction) or using the OligoAnalyzer tool. For complete documentation on the tool, see a) the website, b) the article, c) the source code in the corresponding folder.\nUGENE uses Ghostscript to convert PS files to PNG and PDF.\nToC ToC Prerequisites Open the dialog Input parameters Algorithm settings Display settings Region settings Output settings Internal parameters Saving/resetting dialog state Output data UGENE report HTML report Temporary output Tool comparison References Prerequisites For mfold to work correctly, the path to the temporary directory must not contain spaces, non-printable characters, or non-ASCII characters (Unicode characters such as emoji, Cyrillic, and Chinese family scripts, etc.). In this case, you need to change the path to the temporary directory in the appropriate setting.\nUGENE itself must be installed to a path that does not contain non-printable characters or non-ASCII characters (Unicode characters). If installed incorrectly, an error while running the mfold task will be displayed.\nOpen the dialog mfold only works with DNA or RNA sequences. You can trigger the dialog form by selecting the appropriate Sequence View Global action or through the Main Menu→Actions→Analyze or through the Sequence Context Menu→Analyze This is what the mfold dialog looks like on Windows OS Input parameters The tool is passed explicit and implicit parameters. Explicit parameters are set in the dialog, and implicit parameters are taken from the sequence context.\nAlgorithm settings For complete settings details, see the documentation on the mfold website or documentation in source.\nThis is the Settings section of the mfold settings tab.\nParameter Unit Default Limits Tool argument name Description Temperature °C 37 [0,100] T The folding temperature. For RNA this is always the default value. For DNA it is taken from the dialog. Ionic conditions M Na=1 [0,1.5] NA_CONC Ionic conditions are used to enter total monovalent (Na) and divalent (Mg) ion concentrations. For RNA this is always the default value. For DNA it is taken from the dialog. Mg=0 MG_CONC Percent suboptimality % 5 [1,100] P The suboptimality percentage controls the free energy increment δG for computing suboptimal foldings. Only foldings with a free energy ≤ΔG+δG will be computed, where ΔG is the predicted minimum free energy. Normally, δG=(P/100) Max num of foldings 50 [1,100] MAX This is the maximum number of foldings that mfold will compute. It is better to limit the number of foldings by careful selection of the P and W parameters. Window 0 (len≤29) [0,50] W The window parameter, W, controls the number of foldings that are computed. It may be thought of as a distance parameter. The distance between 2 base pairs, ri rj and ri’ rj’, may be defined as max{ 1 (30≤len≤49) 2 (50≤len≤119) 3 (120≤len≤199) 5 (200≤len≤299) 7 (300≤len≤399) 8 (400≤len≤499) 10 (500≤len≤599) 11 (600≤len≤699) 12 (700≤len≤799) 15 (800≤len≤1199) 20 (1200≤len≤1999) 25 (2000≤len) Max base pair distance ∞ [1,∞] MAXBP If the maximum distance between paired bases parameter, MAXBP, is specified, then any base pair, ri rj, in a folding must satisfy j-i≤MAXBP for a linear sequence or min{j-i, len+i-j}≤MAXBP, for a circular sequence (len is the length of the selected region of the input sequence). Display settings Corresponds to the Extended settings section on the main tab.\nParameter Unit Default Limits Tool argument name Description Base numbering frequency 10 (len≤50) [0,1000] LAB_FR Each image marks the number of the base (nucleotide) starting from the beginning 5’. Frequency with which this number will be displayed on an image depends on this parameter. If it is 0, then the number will not appear anywhere. Region settings Specifies the part of the sequence that will be analyzed. The tool will only work with this piece of the sequence in isolation from the whole sequence.\nYou can select the entire sequence, a custom region, or a selected region if there was one. The region must be less than 3000 bases. It is acceptable to select a small region (\u003c10bp), but there will almost certainly be no folding there.\nIf several regions have been selected in a sequence (using the GenBank format), then the dialog will only accept the first of them. The remaining selected regions are ignored. But there is an exception: if the sequence is marked circular and the region passing through the end/beginning is selected, then such a region is considered as a whole region and mfold will be launched on it as on an ordinary piece of the sequence (2 parts of the region – one that goes to the end and another that starts from the beginning of the sequence – will be combined into one sequence and analyzed). This is the only case where the start of a region can be greater than the end:\nA linear sequence is marked with the symbol and for it the region 70..50 is invalid. A circular sequence is marked with the symbol and for it the region 70..50 is valid. The length of the region in this case 70..50 depends on the sequence length.\nOutput settings UGENE \u0026 Ghostscript settings in the “Output” tab.\nParameter Default Description Save output to /path/to/sequence/ The folder where the “mfold” subdirectory will be created with the output data in it. By default, this folder is the same as the folder where the input sequence is stored. The output folder must have write permissions. DPI 96 Setting up the Ghostscript converter from PS files to PNG. Quality of saved images (PNG files). The higher this parameter, the higher the quality, size, and resolution of the resulting images. Internal parameters Settings that the user cannot explicitly influence.\nMolecule Type (DNA/RNA). mfold gets sequence information from command line arguments. Information about what type will be passed to the tool can be seen next to the sequence name Molecule Topology (linear/circular). mfold gets sequence information from command line arguments. If the sequence is marked as circular, then mfold will work with it as a circular one. Otherwise, as with a linear one. Whether the sequence is linear/circular is described here. Part of a circular sequence will also be considered a circular sequence. If you want to change this behavior, uncheck “Mark sequence as circular” and then call the mfold dialog. DPI of images in UGENE. Ghostscript has a default DPI of 72. Therefore, this value is used for images for the internal UGENE report and this value cannot be changed. Saving/resetting dialog state Some dialog fields retain their state between dialog calls. For such fields, the ability to reset settings is also available (the “Reset settings” button at the bottom left in the screenshot of the dialog). Below is a table showing which states are saved between dialog calls and which of them can be reset to default values.\nSave states Reset states Algorithm settings yes (it can be tedious to enter fields every time) Display settings Region no (since the region is optionally selected manually by the user) Output settings yes States are saved only for a specific sequence window. Thus, if you have two windows (or two views) for sequence-1 and one window for sequence-2, then each window will have its own state for the mfold dialog.\nOutput data There are 3 types of output from the mfold task in UGENE:\nReport displayed inside UGENE. HTML report with images saved on disk. Temporary data (for advanced users). UGENE report Example of a report on Windows (appearance may vary slightly between systems):\nStatus, Time, … At the beginning, there is information about the run: information about the task, settings for the launch. Output HTML report. Clickable link to the output HTML report. More about this report in the next section. Found structures. List of found structures. The structure is characterized by free energy. When clicked, UGENE will scroll the window to the desired structure. Structure table. For each found structure, the table contains: Thermodynamic details: Free energy, enthalpy, entropy, and an estimated Tm. Loop Free-Energy Decomposition: The entire decomposition of the particular folding into loops and stacks, together with their free energies and closing base pairs. Consecutive runs of base pairs are summarized as helices. Image. Displays of nucleic acid secondary structure. At the bottom of the image, there is information identifying it: free energy, name of the input sequence, and analyzed region. It has the fixed DPI of 72. If no structure is found, mfold will fail with an error and display a corresponding message “No hairpins found. Nothing to show”. No new files will be created.\nSometimes the report may not contain the structure table. This happens because there are a lot of results/the resulting decomposition tables are too large. In this case, the result must be viewed in a browser (click on the “Output HTML report” link).\nHTML report A single HTML report and PNG+PDF for each structure found are saved in the output folder. The HTML report displays these images, PDFs, and detailed information about the launch in an easy-to-view form. This version of the report also contains:\nLaunch information. List of found structures with links to them. Information about each structure. The Loop Free-Energy Decomposition is located under the “Show structure detailed info” arrow. The quality of the images in the report depends on the DPI setting in the dialog. When you click on the picture, a PDF file with a structure image opens in a new tab, identical to the picture image, but allows you to zoom without losing quality. mfold log. This report is portable, i.e., if the directory is completely copied (HTML+all PNGs+all PDFs), the copied data can be re-opened in the browser without loss of functionality. Folders can be deleted/renamed; it will not affect the operation of UGENE.\nTemporary output For advanced users.\nmfold produces many files. Not all of them are displayed in the reports. However, while the current UGENE session is open, you can see what other files mfold produces.\nIn the Log corresponding to the [Algorithms][DETAILS] subcategories, you can see the mfold launch command. It depends on where the UGENE temporary directory is set. For example, it might look like this:\n“C:\\Program Files\\Unipro UGENE\\tools\\mfold\\mfold.bat” SEQ=C:\\tmp\\ugene_tmp\\p14120\\mfold\\d_0\\inp.fa RUN_TYPE=html NA=DNA LC=circular T=37 P=5 NA_CONC=1 MG_CONC=0 MAX=100 ROT_ANG=0\nIn this case, all temporary output files will be located in C:\\tmp\\ugene_tmp\\p14120\\mfold\\d_0. For information about the purpose and format of this data, please read the article.\nDo not modify/move/delete these files. They are read-only.\nTool comparison As mentioned earlier, the mfold tool can also be launched from the native site or from the IDT platform.\nUGENE unafold.org OligoAnalyzer Internet connection not required must be (http connection) must be Privacy share only what you want results are visible to everyone results are visible only to you Storing results stored as long as needed are removed over time stored while the session is open (30 minutes) File output completeness no energy dot plot there are all files including energy dot plot there is an energy dot plot but not some other side files Image quality vector format is represented by PDF files; quality of raster images (PNG) is configurable vector format is represented by PDF and PS files; quality of raster images (PNG, JPEG) is configurable no vector format; raster images aren’t configurable Completeness of algorithm settings some settings for RNA aren’t taken into account; no constraints all; constraints can be specified truncated part; no constraints, have their own settings Completeness of display settings impossible to specify region’s offset relative to original sequence offset setting no offset Max sequence length 3000 2400 255 See more RNA structure prediction software\nReferences Article https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC169194/ mfold home http://www.unafold.org/ mfold DNA prediction http://www.unafold.org/mfold/applications/dna-folding-form.php mfold RNA prediction http://www.unafold.org/mfold/applications/rna-folding-form.php mfold sources http://www.unafold.org/mfold/software/download-mfold.php mfold settings documentation http://www.unafold.org/mfold/documentation/mfold-documentation.php Viewing launch results http://www.unafold.org/cgi-bin/view-folds.cgi Forum with mfold authors http://www.unafold.org/forum/ mfold references http://www.unafold.org/mfold/documentation/mfold-references.php Implementation of mfold by IDT company (OligoAnalyzer) https://www.idtdna.com/calc/analyzer ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"mfold The tool was added in version 50.\nThe ‘mfold’ software is a tool …","ref":"/extensions/mfold/","tags":"","title":"mfold"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/categories/","tags":"","title":"Categories"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/tags/","tags":"","title":"Tags"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/","tags":"","title":"UGENE User Manual"}]
