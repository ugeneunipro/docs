### Selection in the Alignment Editor Components

In the _Name List_ and the _Sequence Area_, selection is visualized as a rectangle with a dashed border. In the _Consensus Area_, the consensus sequence characters of the corresponding columns are shown with a light gray background:

### Selecting a Region Using the Mouse and Keyboard Shortcuts

Using the mouse, one can select:

* Several consecutive sequences in the _Name List_.
* Several consecutive columns in the _Consensus Area_.
* An alignment region in the _Sequence Area_.

By holding the _Shift_ key, it is possible to select a region between two coordinates of a mouse click. For example, if there is a large alignment, one can click on a character (the left upper coordinate of the region), press _Shift_, scroll to the required location of the alignment, and click on another character (the right bottom coordinate of the region).

It is possible to modify a selection in the _Sequence Area_ by dragging the selection rectangle border:

Press the _Esc_ key to clear the selection.
