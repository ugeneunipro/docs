# Removing Gap at the Left

To remove a gap in the _Sanger Reads Editor_, select the next character or gap after the gap you want to remove and press _Backspace_. You can also select _Edit_ -> _Remove gap at the left_ in the context menu or go to _Actions_ -> _Edit_ -> _Remove gap at the left_.

If there is a region of gaps or it is the beginning of a read, by holding the _Backspace_ key, you can shift a Sanger read to the left. To shift the read to the right, hold the _Space_ key. For more information, see the [Inserting Gap](inserting-gap) chapter.

You can always cancel the changes by pressing _Ctrl+Z_.
