# SITECON

_SITECON_ is a program package designed for the recognition of potential transcription factor binding sites based on data about conserved conformational and physicochemical properties, which are revealed through the analysis of binding site sets.

To cite SITECON, use the following article:

“Oshchepkov D.Y., Vityaev E.E., Grigorovich D.A., Ignatieva E.V., Khlebodarova T.M. SITECON: a tool for detecting conservative conformational and physicochemical properties in transcription factor binding site alignments and for site recognition. //Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Jul 1;32(Web Server issue):W208-12.”

The UGENE version of SITECON provides a tool for the recognition of potential binding sites for over [_90 types_](types-of-sitecon-models.md) of transcription factors. Additionally, the UGENE version of SITECON offers a tool for recognizing potential binding sites based on site alignments proposed by the user. For a detailed method description, see the [original SITECON site](http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/cgi-bin/mgs/sitecon/sitecon.pl?stage=0).

Data about the context-dependent conformational and physicochemical properties used are available in the [PROPERTY Database](http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/gnw/bdna).
