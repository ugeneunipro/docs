# Available Fragments

All fragments available in the current project are shown in the _Available Fragments_ list.

You can automatically create a fragment from a DNA molecule from the current UGENE _project_. Click the _From Project_ button to do so. The _Select Item_ dialog will appear with the available sequence objects. Select a sequence and press the _OK_ button. After that, create a fragment in the _Create DNA Fragment_ dialog as described in the [_Creating Fragment_](../creating-fragment) paragraph. The fragment created from the sequence will appear in the list of available fragments.
