# Opening 3D Structure Viewer

The _3D Structure Viewer_ is opened automatically when you open a PDB or MMDB file.

For example, [_open_](http://ugene.unipro.ru/documentation/manual/basic_functions/opening_document.html#opening-document) `$UGENE/data/samples/PDB/1CF7.PDB`. The 3D Structure Viewer adds a view to the upper part of the _Sequence View_:

Notice the _Links_ button on the toolbar. When you click the button, a menu appears with quick links to online resources providing detailed information about the opened molecule:

*   PDB Wiki
*   RCSB PDB
*   PDBsum
*   NCBI MMDB

Note that if you’re online, you can access the Protein Data Bank directly from UGENE and load the required file by its PDB ID (see [_Fetching Data from Remote Database_](../../basic-functions/fetching-data-from-remote-database) for details).

**Hint**: Don’t forget to select the correct database (PDB) while fetching.
