# Locked Documents

To lock the _document_ that is already present in the current _project_ select it in the [_Project View_](https://ugene.unipro.ru/wiki/display/UUOUM16/Project+View) and click on the _Lock document for editing_ context menu item.

The lock icon in the document element indicates that the document canâ€™t be modified:

UGENE does not allow modification of some formats that were created not by UGENE.

If UGENE is able only to read a document (see the [_Supported File Formats_](Appendix-A.supported-file-formats.md) chapter), you can export the document objects to a file. To do it use the [_built-in export utilities_](exporting-objects.md).

Also, you can [_export_](http://ugene.unipro.ru/documentation/manual/basic_functions/export_objects.html#export-objects) the document objects of unlocked documents.
