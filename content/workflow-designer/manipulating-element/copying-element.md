# Copying Elements

To copy one or several [_workflow elements_](../introduction/workflow-elements-and-connections), select them on the [_Scene_](../introduction/workflow-designer-window-components). Note that you can hold the Ctrl key to select multiple elements. Then choose the _Copy_ option from the _Actions_ main menu or from a selected element's context menu.

The Ctrl+C hotkey is also available for this action.

Now you can [_paste_](pasting-element) these elements somewhere on the Scene.
