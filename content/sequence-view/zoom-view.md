# Zoom View

The _Sequence zoom view_ is designed to provide flexible tools for navigation in large annotated sequence regions.

The most _Sequence zoom view_ space is used to visualize annotations for the sequence. The annotations are organized in rows by their names. If two annotations with the same name overlap, an extra row is created. For every row the name and the total number of annotations in the row are shown with a light grey text at the left part of the area.

Below the annotation rows there is a ruler to show coordinates in the sequence.
