# Manipulating Workflow

You can create a new [_workflow_](workflow-elements-and-connections.md), save it and then load it again.

The designed workflow can be dispalyed in a neat self-describing layout and exported to PDF document, rastor or vector image with publication-ready quality.

You can validate created or modified workflow before running it.

If you need, you can stop a workflow execution.
