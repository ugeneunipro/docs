# Cutting Element

To cut one or several [_workflow elements_](workflow-elements-and-connections.md) select them on the [_Scene_](workflow-designer-window-components.md). Choose the _Cut_ item in the _Actions_ main menu or in a selected element context menu.

The Ctrl+X hotkey is also available for this action.

Now you can _[paste](pasting-element.md)_ these elements.
