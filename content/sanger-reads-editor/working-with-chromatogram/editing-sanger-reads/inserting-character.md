# Inserting a Character

To insert a nucleotide into a read in the _Sanger Reads Editor_, select a nucleotide or a gap at the desired location in the _Chromatogram Area_. Switch to editing mode by pressing _Shift+I_, choosing _Edit_ -> _Insert character/gap_ in the context menu, or selecting _Actions -> Edit -> Insert character/gap_ in the main menu. Once the cursor is blinking, type the character you wish to insert. Afterward, the editing mode will be turned off.

Note that if you press the '-' key on the keyboard while in editing mode, a gap will be inserted. Another way to insert a gap is by pressing _Space_, as explained in the [Inserting Gap](inserting-gap) chapter.

You can always cancel the changes by pressing _Ctrl+Z_.
