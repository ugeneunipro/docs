# Saving Schema

To save a _schema_ from the _Query Designer_ select the _Actions â€£ Save Schema_ item in the main menu or the _Save Schema_ toolbar button.

When you save a schema for the first time the _Save Schema_ dialog appears where you should input a name and browse for a location of the schema file. The schema is saved to a file with the \*.uql extension.

To save a schema to a different file select the _Save Schema As_ item on the toolbar or in the _Actions_ main menu.
