_Delete the selected breakpoints_ - this button deletes the selected breakpoint.

_Delete all breakpoints_ - this button deletes all breakpoints.

_Enable or disable all breakpoints_ - this button checks or unchecks all breakpoints. Checking a breakpoint means that the breakpoint is enabled and will be used.

_Highlight selected item_ - this button highlights the breakpoint element.
