# Zoom View

The _Sequence Zoom View_ is designed to provide flexible tools for navigation in large annotated sequence regions.

The space in the _Sequence Zoom View_ is primarily used to visualize annotations for the sequence. The annotations are organized in rows by their names. If two annotations with the same name overlap, an extra row is created. The name and the total number of annotations in each row are shown in light grey text on the left side of the area.

Below the annotation rows, there is a ruler to show coordinates in the sequence.
