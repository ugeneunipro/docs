The following settings are available on the tab:

_Language of User Interface (applied after restart)_ — here you can select UGENE localization. Currently, available localizations are EN and RU. The default value (_Autodetection_) specifies that UGENE should use the operating system's regional options to select the localization. This setting is applied only after UGENE is reopened.

_Appearance_ — defines the appearance of the application.

_Open last project at startup_ — if the option is checked, the last project is opened when UGENE is started. Also, you can choose default settings for saving projects.

_Enable statistical reports collecting_ — collects information about UGENE usage and sends it to the UGENE team to help improve the application.

The collected information includes:

1. System info: UGENE version, OS name, Qt version, etc.
2. Counters info: number of launches of certain tasks (e.g., HMM search, MUSCLE align).

The collected information DOES NOT include any personal data.

_Check for updates when UGENE starts_ — checks for updates when UGENE starts.

_Default settings_ — this option resets the default settings on the next run.
