# Replacing Selected Character

To replace a symbol in the alignment, select the nucleotide and press _Shift+R_ to switch the edit mode on.

While the selection is blinking, press the keyboard character you want to replace the nucleotide with.

After that, the edit mode is switched off. To replace another nucleotide, press _Shift+R_ again.

You can always cancel the changes by pressing _Ctrl+Z_.
