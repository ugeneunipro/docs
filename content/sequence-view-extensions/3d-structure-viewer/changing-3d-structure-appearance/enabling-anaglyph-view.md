# Enabling Anaglyph View

UGENE allows you to view a molecule in anaglyph mode. To enable the anaglyph view, open the _Settings_ dialog of the 3D Structure Viewer and check the _Anaglyph view_ checkbox.

You can modify the color settings by selecting one of the available _Glasses colors_ or setting custom colors, and you can also swap the colors.

The offset of the color layers can be adjusted by dragging the _Eyes shift_ slider.
