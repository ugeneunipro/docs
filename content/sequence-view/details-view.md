# Details View

The _Sequence details view_ is a supplementary component of the _Sequence overview_. It is used to display sequence content without the need for zooming. Every time you double-click the sequence in the _Sequence overview_ area or select an annotation, the corresponding sequence position becomes visible in the _Sequence details view_.

For a DNA sequence, the _Sequence details view_ automatically shows the complementary DNA strand and 6 amino acid translation frames.
