# Selecting Models to Display

When a molecular structure contains multiple models (e.g., NMR ensembles of models), the _Models_ item appears in the 3D Structure Viewer context menu and in the _Display_ menu on the toolbar. For example, for a protein with PDB ID [1ZNF](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1znf), the menu looks as follows:

The dialog will appear:

To show all the models, check the _All_ item. To display only one model, select the item and click the _OK_ button. To show several models, select them and click the _OK_ button. To show the inverted selection, click the _Invert_ button and then click the _OK_ button.
