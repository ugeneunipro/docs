# Building HMM Model

The _HMM3 build_ tool is used to construct a new HMM profile from a multiple alignment. You can use any alignment file formats supported by UGENE.

The output HMM profile format is compatible with the HMMER3 package, but it is not compatible with HMMER2.

The _HMM3 build_ automatically calibrates the target model.
