# Circular Molecule

To consider the sequence as circular and be able to search for restriction sites between the end and the beginning of the sequence check the _Circular molecule_ option.

**Example:** Let’s consider:

*   The sequence is “CTGC ... CAC”.
*   _AarI_ restriction enzyme (with recognition sequence “CACCTGC”) has been checked.

In this case if the _Circular molecule_ option has been checked, the restriction site will be found. If it hasn’t been checked, the restriction site won’t be found (in this position).
