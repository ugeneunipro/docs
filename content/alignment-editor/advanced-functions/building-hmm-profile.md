# Building HMM Profile

The editor has the capability to build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile based on multiple sequence alignments.

This functionality is based on [Sean Eddy’s HMMER](http://hmmer.janelia.org/) package.

To build an HMM profile, select the _Advanced ‣ Build HMMER2 profile_ or the _Advanced ‣ Build HMMER3 profile_ option in the _Actions_ main menu or in the context menu.

Learn more about the HMM tool in the documentation pages of the [_HMM2_](hmm2.md) and [_HMM3_](hmm3.md) plugins.
