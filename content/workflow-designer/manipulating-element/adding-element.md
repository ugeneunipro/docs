# Adding Element

There are several ways to add an [_element_](../introduction/workflow-elements-and-connections) to the [_Scene_](../introduction/workflow-designer-window-components).

The easiest way is to drag the required element from the [_Palette_](../introduction/workflow-designer-window-components) to the Scene. Alternatively, you can click on the element in the Palette and then click somewhere on the Scene.

You can also select an element in the _Add item_ submenu of the _Actions_ main menu or the Scene context menu. For example:

![](/images/2097157/2359309.png)

Once the required element is selected, click somewhere on the Scene to insert it.
