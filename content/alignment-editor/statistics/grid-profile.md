# Grid Profile

Using the _Alignment Editor_ you can create a statistic profile of a multiple sequence alignment.

The alignment grid profile shows positional amino acid or nucleotide counts highlighted according to the frequency of symbols in a row.

To create a grid profile, use the _Statistics â€£ Generate grid profile_ item in the _Actions_ main menu or in the context menu.

To learn more about this feature, refer to the [_DNA Statistics_](dna-statistics.md) plugin documentation.
