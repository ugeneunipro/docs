# Replacing Character and Gap

To replace a read symbol or gap in the _Sanger Reads Editor_, select the nucleotide and press _Shift+R_ or use the _Edit_â€“>_Replace character/gap_ context menu to switch the edit mode on.

While the selection is blinking, press the keyboard character that you want to use as a replacement.

After that, the edit mode is switched off. To replace another symbol, press _Shift+R_ again.

You can always cancel the changes by pressing _Ctrl+Z_.
