# Automatic Annotations Highlighting

Enabling the automatic annotations highlighting allows you to automatically calculate and highlight annotations on each nucleotide sequence opened.

Currently, the following annotations types support the automatic highlighting:

*   Open reading frames
*   Restriction sites
*   Plasmid features

The corresponding groups of annotations found are stored in the _Auto-annotations_ object in the _Annotations editor_, for example:
