# Export Highlighting to File

![](/images/96666040/96666045.png)

Select the output file to export the highlighting, choose exported area and click on the _Export_ button. The task report will appear in the _[Notifications](notifications.md)_.

Also, you may set additional parameters:

*   **Indexing** \- select the number to start counting from:
    *   _1-based_ - the first column has number **1**,
    *   _0-based_ - the first column has number **0**.
*   **Keep gaps** - check if you want to store gap symbols in the result file.
*   **Dots instead not highlighted** - replace not-highlighted bases with dots in the result file.
*   **Transpose output** - if this checkbox is checked, the sequences will be located horizontally (not vertically, as in UGENE). May be useful, if you have a long alignment, but not many sequences.
