# Creating New Project

A _project_ stores links to data files, cross-file data associations, and visualization settings.

Below is a description of how to create a new project manually. Note that if you have no project created when opening a file with a sequence, an alignment, or any other biological data, a new anonymous project is created automatically.

To create a new project, select the _File â€£ New project_ menu or click the _New project_ button on the main toolbar.

The dialog will appear:

![](/images/65929273/65929274.png)

Here you need to specify the visual name for the project and the directory and file to store it.

After you click the _Create_ button, the [_Project View_](ugene-window-components/project-view) window is opened.
