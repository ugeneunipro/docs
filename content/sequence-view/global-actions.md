# Global Actions

![](/images/65929375/65929376.png)

The global action toolbar provides the possibility to navigate to a specified position (in all sequences simultaneously).

It also allows you to lock or adjust the ranges of sequences in the same _Sequence View_. See [_this paragraph_](manipulating-sequence/locking-and-synchronize-ranges-of-several-sequences) for details.
