You can paste [_workflow elements_](workflow-elements-and-connections.md) that have been [_cut_](cutting-element.md) or [_copied_](copying-element.md).

To do it choose the _Paste_ item in the _Actions_ main menu or in the [_Scene_](workflow-designer-window-components.md) context menu.

Or use the Ctrl+V hotkey to paste the elements.
