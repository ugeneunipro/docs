# Moving Subalignment

To move subalignment, there are several methods:

1.  Select a subalignment and drag and drop it. The subalignment will be moved.
2.  By using the _Space_ key, the subalignment will be moved to the right by the size of the selection. By using the _Backspace_ key, the subalignment will be returned to its initial state.
3.  By using _Ctrl+Space_, the subalignment will be moved to the right by one column. By using _Ctrl+Backspace_, the subalignment will be returned to its initial state.
4.  By using _Ctrl_, you can join the parts of an alignment. When you have a fragment of characters surrounded by gaps in a row, select a continuous block without gaps while pressing _Ctrl_ and move the selection to the right or left.
