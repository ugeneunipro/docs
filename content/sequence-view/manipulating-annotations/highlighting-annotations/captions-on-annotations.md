# Captions on Annotations

In the _Sequence Zoom View_, you can display the value of a qualifier of an annotation instead of the annotation type name. To enable this option for an annotation type, check the _Show value of qualifier_ checkbox and input the values of the required qualifiers in the text field next to this checkbox. See the image below.

If you input several qualifier names (separated by commas), the first found qualifier is considered and displayed on the annotation.
