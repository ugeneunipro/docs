The following parameters are available:

- _Distance algorithm:_ There are two distance algorithms—"Hamming distance" for dissimilarity and "Simple similarity" for similarity.

- _Profile mode: Counts/Percents_ — Select the _Percents_ option to display scores as percentages in the report. You can also _Exclude gaps_ if desired.

- _Show group statistics of multiple alignment_ — Displays group statistics when collapsing is enabled.

- _Save profile to file_ — Allows saving the profile to a file in HTML or CSV format. The CSV format is convenient for further processing in spreadsheet editors like Excel.

The resulting profile in the HTML mode:
