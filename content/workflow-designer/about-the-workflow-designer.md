# About the Workflow Designer

The _Workflow Designer_ allows a molecular biologist to create and run complex computational workflow schemas, even if he or she is not familiar with any programming language.

The workflow schemas comprise reproducible, reusable, and self-documented research routines, with a simple and unambiguous visual representation suitable for publications.

The workflow schemas can be run both locally and remotely, either using a graphical interface or launched from the command line.

The elements that a schema consists of correspond to the bulk of algorithms integrated into UGENE. Additionally, you can create custom workflow elements.
