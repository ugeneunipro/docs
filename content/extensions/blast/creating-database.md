The _Make Blast Database_ dialog appears:

Here, you must select the input files. If all the files you want to use are located in one directory, you can simply select the directory with the files. By default, only files with \*.fa and \*.fasta extensions are taken into account. You can change this by specifying either an _Include files filter_ or an _Exclude files filter_.

You can choose either _protein_ or _nucleotide_ type for the files.

Then, you must select the path to save the database file and specify a _Base name for BLAST files_ and a _Title for the database file_.
