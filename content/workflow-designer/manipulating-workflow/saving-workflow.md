# Saving Workflow

Select the _Actions ‣ Save workflow_ item in the main menu or the _Save workflow_ toolbar button to save a workflow. The workflow is saved to a file in UGENE's native format (with a .uwl extension).

The format is human-readable. You can find its description in the chapter [_Workflow File Format_](workflow-file-format.md).

There is a Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut for this action.

If you are saving a workflow for the first time, the _Workflow properties_ dialog appears:

Here, you can browse for the workflow file _Location_ and specify the workflow _Name_ and _Comment_.

Once a workflow has been saved, it can be [_loaded_](loading-workflow). If you modify the loaded workflow and save the changes, the corresponding .uwl file is updated.

To save the workflow with different properties, choose the _Actions ‣ Save workflow as_ item in the main menu and specify the required settings in the _Workflow properties_ dialog.
