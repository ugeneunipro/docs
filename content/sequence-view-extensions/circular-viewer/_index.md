# Circular Viewer

The _Circular Viewer_ plugin provides the capability to show the circular view of a nucleotide sequence.

**Usage example:**

Open a nucleotide sequence object in the _Sequence View_. The _Show circular view_ button is available on the sequence toolbar:

Pressing the button will show the circular view of the sequence:

If you work with a file with many sequences the button closes circular views if some circular views are opened and if all circular views are closed, it opens all of them.

Also, you can mark sequences as circular in UGENE by the _Mark as circular_ sequence context menu item. When the sequences are marked as _Circular_, the Circular View is automatically opened for them in all opened Sequence View windows.

The _Restriction Sites Map_ will appear automatically. To show restriction sites the _Show Restriction Sites_ menu should be checked. To hide the map click on the following button:

The _Circular Viewer_ has opened automatically when the _Sequence View_ is opened for a plasmid.

The inner-circle represents the sequence clockwise and the scale marks show the corresponding sequence positions. The sequence annotations are represented as curved colored regions at the outer side of the circle.

The _Circular Viewer_ helps to navigate within the sequence. You can select an annotation on the circular view and the annotation will also be focused and highlighted in all _Sequence View_ areas: _Sequence overview_, _Sequence zoom view_, _Sequence details view,_ and _Annotations editor_.

You can also select a sequence region:

This will also affect the _Sequence View_. You can select a sequence region with _Ctrl_ and the selection will be inverted.

Note that the circular view is zoomed automatically when the _Circular Viewer_ area is resized:

So you can adjust it to an appropriate size.

It is possible to rotate the circular view using the mouse wheel. Also, it is possible to shift the start point of a circular molecule by _E__dit sequence -> Set new sequence origin_ context menu item.

Use the _Export â€£ Save circular view as image_ context menu or the _Actions_ main menu item to save the image of the circular view.

The _Export Image_ dialog will appear:

You can set _Include position marker_ and _Include selection_ marker in the image by the corresponding checkboxes.

Here you can browse for the file name, and select the width, height, and resolution of the image as well as its format: SVG, BMP, JPG, PNG, PDF, PS, and TIFF. Pay attention to _Quality_ slider, it is present for JPG format only.

Note, that if a sequence file contains several sequences it is possible to view the circular views of the sequences in the same _Circular Viewer_ area.

You can work with these circular views at the same time.
