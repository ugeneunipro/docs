# Zooming to Selected Region

To select a dot plot region, activate the _Select tool_:

Hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse cursor over the dot plot.

When you select a region on a dot plot, the corresponding region is also selected in other _Sequence View_ areas (_Sequence details view_, _Sequence zoom view_, etc.).

The opposite is true as well: if you select a region in a _Sequence View_ area, the corresponding region is also selected in the dot plot view.

To zoom to the selected region, click the _Zoom in_ on the left.
