# Transform into a Primer Pair

UGENE has a specific primer format that enables access to certain features only when this format is recognized. Examples of these features include:

* Create PCR Fragment
* [Primer-BLAST](../../extensions/remote-blast/primer-blast)

If you have a primer pair that does not fit this format, these features will be unavailable to you. To resolve this issue:

1. Select your left and right primers.
2. Right-click → Edit → Transform into a primer pair.
