&lt;p>This workflow builds a new profile HMM from input alignment, calibrates the HMM and saves to a file. Then runs a test
HMM search over sample sequence and saves test results to Genbank file.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This workflow reads an HMM from a file and searches input sequences for significantly similar matches, saves found signals to a file. You can specify several input files for both HMM and sequences, the workflow will process Cartesian product of inputs. That is, each sequence will be searched with all specified HMMs in turn.&lt;/p>
