# File Format


![](/images/65929351/65929352.png)

The _Sequence Annotations_ settings allows to use upper/lower case annotations during the file reading process.

Format options:

1.  _Don’t use case annotations_ (default mode) — usual sequence reading and writing.
2.  _Use lower case annotation_ — sequences are read and annotations with names _lower\_case_ are added. When these sequences are written to file then the case becomes like original the file case (the case is saved).
3.  _Use upper case annotation_ — there is a similar behavior but with “upper\_case” annotations.
