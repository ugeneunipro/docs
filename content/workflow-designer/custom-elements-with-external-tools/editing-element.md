# Editing Element

The element created appears in the _Custom Elements with External Tools_ group on the _Palette_.

To edit an element select the _Edit_ item in its context menu in the [_Palette_](workflow-designer-window-components.md) or select the _Edit configuration_ item in its context menu on the _Scene_. The creation element wizard would appear.
