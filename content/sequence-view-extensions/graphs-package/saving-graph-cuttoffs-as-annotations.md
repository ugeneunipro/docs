The following parameters are available:

_Maximum cutoff_ - maximum cutoff value.

_Minimum cutoff_ - minimum cutoff value.

_Around cutoff values_ - saves the values around cutoffs values.

_Between cutoff values_ - saves the values between cutoffs values.

In the _Save annotation(s) to_ group you can set up a file to store annotations.  It could be either an existing annotation table object, a new annotation table or auto-annotations table (if it is available).

In the _Annotation parameters_ group you can specify the name of the group and the name of the annotation. If the group name is set to <auto> UGENE will use the group name as the name for the group. You can use the ‘/’ characters in this field as a group name separator to create subgroups. If the annotation name is set to _by type_ UGENE will use the annotation type from the _Annotation type:_ table as the name for the annotation. Also you can add a description in the corresponding text field.

Select the parameters and click on the _Save_ button. The corresponding annotations will be saved.
