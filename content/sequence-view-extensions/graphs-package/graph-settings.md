The following parameters are available:

- _Window_ — the number of bases in a window.
- _Steps per window_ — the number of steps in the window. The _Step_ is calculated as _Window_ / _Steps per window_.
- _Default color_ — the default color of the graph line (or lines of graphs for _GC Frame Plot_).

Checking the _Cutoff for minimum and maximum values_ checkbox enables the following settings:

- _Minimum_ — the minimum value for the cutoff.
- _Maximum_ — the maximum value for the cutoff.

Select an appropriate minimum and maximum value and click the _OK_ button to display the graph with cutoffs. The graph is divided into two parts. The upper part shows values greater than the specified _Maximum_ value, while the lower part of the graph shows values lower than the specified _Minimum_ value. For example:
