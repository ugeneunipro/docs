# BWA

_BWA_ is a fast, lightweight tool that aligns relatively short reads to a reference sequence. Click [this link](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) to open the _BWA_ homepage. _BWA_ is embedded as an [_external tool_](external-tools-plugin.md) into UGENE.

Open the _Tools â€£ DNA assembly_ submenu of the main menu.

Select the _Align short reads_ item to align short reads to a DNA sequence using _BWA_, or select the _Build index_ item to build an index for a DNA sequence, which can be used to optimize the alignment of short reads.
