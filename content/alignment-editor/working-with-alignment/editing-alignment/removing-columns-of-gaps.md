There are the following options:

_Remove columns with number of gaps_ — removes columns with a number of gaps greater than or equal to the specified value.

_Remove columns with percentage of gaps_ — removes columns with a percentage of gaps greater than or equal to the specified value.

_Remove all columns of gaps_ — this option is selected by default. It specifies to remove columns from the alignment if they consist entirely of gaps.

Select the required option and press the _Remove_ button.
