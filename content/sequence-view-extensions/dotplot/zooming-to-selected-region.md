# Zooming to Selected Region

To select a dotplot region activate the _Select tool_:

hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse cursor over the dotplot.

When you select a region on a dotplot the corresponding region is also selected in other _Sequence View_ areas (_Sequence details view_, _Sequence zoom view_, etc.).

The opposite is true as well: if you select a region in a _Sequence View_ area, the corresponding region is also selected in the dotplot view.

To zoom to the region selected click the _Zoom in_ on the left.
