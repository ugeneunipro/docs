# Workflow Designer Window Components

Each Workflow Designer window consists of:

**Palette**

The _Elements_ tab of the palette contains [_workflow elements_](workflow-elements-and-connections.md) for most algorithms intergrated in UGENE and sets of common input / output routines. The elements are grouped into categories that reflect their uses and features. The _Samples_ tab of the palette contains examples of _[workflow](workflow-elements-and-connections.md)_.

**Scene**

The main drawing scene is the place where the workflow elements are constructed into a workflow.

**Property Editor**

Provides information about a currently selected workflow element and allows configuring it.

On the image below you can see these components in a maximized Workflow Designer window:

All these components are resizable and can be adjusted to individual needs.
