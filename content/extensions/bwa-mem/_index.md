# BWA-MEM

_BWA_ is a fast light-weighted tool that aligns relatively short reads to a reference sequence. Click [this link](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) to open _BWA_ homepage. BWA-MEM is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

Open _Tools â€£ Align to reference_ submenu of the main menu.

Select the _Align short reads_ item to align short reads to a DNA sequence using _BWA-MEM_. Or select the _Build index_ item to build an index for a DNA sequence which can be used to optimize aligning of short reads.
