Here you must select the input files. If all the files you want to use are located in one directory, you can simply select the directory with the files. By default, only the files are taken into account with \*.fa and \*.fasta extensions. You can change this by specifying either _Include files filter_ or exclude _files filter_.

You can choose either _protein_ or _nucleotide_ type of the files.

Then you must select the path to save the database file and specify a _Base name for BLAST files_ and a _Title for the database file_.
