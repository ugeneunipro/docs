# Highlight Region on 3D Structure

When you are [selecting a region of a sequence](../../sequence-view/manipulating-sequence/selecting-sequence-region), for example in the _Sequence Zoom View_, the corresponding region on the 3D structure is highlighted, while the remaining regions of the 3D structure are shaded.

To configure the color of a selected region, open the _Settings_ dialog (press the _Settings_ item in the 3D Structure Viewer context menu or in the _Display_ menu on the toolbar), click the _Set Selection Color_ button and choose a color in the dialog that appears.

To adjust the shading, drag the _Unselected Regions Shading_ slider in the _Settings_ dialog.
