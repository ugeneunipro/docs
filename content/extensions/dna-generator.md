# DNA Generator

DNA sequence generator is a tool that generates a random DNA sequence with specified nucleotide content. To generate a random DNA sequence select the _Toolsâ†’Random sequence generator_ item in the main menu. The dialog will appear:

The following parameters are available:

_Length_ - Length of the resulted sequence(s) (using '1000' bp by default).

_Window size_ - The DNA sequence generation is divided into windows of the specified size. In each window, the ratio of the base, defined by other parameters, is kept (using '1000' by default).

_Number of sequences_ - the number of sequences to generate (using '1' by default).

_Initialize random generator manually_ - value to initialize the random generator.

_Reference_ - path to the reference file (could be a sequence or an alignment).

_Base content_ - set the base content percents manually.

_GC Skew -_ set the GC skew of the resulted sequence.

_Output file - output file._

_Format_ - output file format (using 'fasta' by default).

_Add to project_ - adds the generated sequence(s) to the project.

Once the _Generate_ button has been pressed, the sequence(s) are created.
