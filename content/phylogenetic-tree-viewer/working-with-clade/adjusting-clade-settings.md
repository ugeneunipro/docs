# Adjusting Clade Settings

When a clade is selected the [_branch_](adjusting-branch-settings.md) and the [_labels formatting_](changing-labels-formatting.md) settigns are applied to the clade only.

Note that the settings are not applied to the [_collapsed_](collapsing-and-expanding-branches.md) branches (if any).

See an example of changing branch settings for a clade:
