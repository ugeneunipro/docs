# Exporting Tree Image

A tree image can be exported to a raster format (.png, .jpg, .bmp, etc.) or to a vector format (.svg).

To export a tree image, select either the _Export Tree Image_ toolbar button or the _Actions â€£ Export Tree Image_ option in the main menu.

In the submenu that appears, select the _Save visible area to file..._ option to save the tree image in a raster format. The standard _Save As_ dialog will appear, allowing you to choose the file name and format.

To export a tree image to a vector format, select the _Save whole tree as SVG_ option in the _Export Tree Image_ submenu.

To copy a tree to the clipboard, select the _Copy to clipboard_ submenu.
