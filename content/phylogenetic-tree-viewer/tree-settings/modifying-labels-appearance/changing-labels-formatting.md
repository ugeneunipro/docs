# Changing Labels Formatting

To change formatting of a tree labels select the _Labels_ _Formatting_ toolbar button or the _Tree settings Options Panel_ tab:


![](/images/65929735/65929736.png)

Here you can select color, font, size and attributes (bold, italic, etc.) of the labels.

Note that when [_a clade has been selected_](selecting-clade.md) the labels formatting settings are applied to the clade only.
