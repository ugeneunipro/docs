# Exporting Tree Image

A tree image can be exported to a raster format (.png, .jpg, .bmp, etc.) or to a vector format (.svg).

Select either the _Export Tree Image_ toolbar button or the _Actions â€£ Export Tree Image_ item in the main menu.

In the submenu that appeared select the _Save visible area to file..._ item to save the tree image to a raster format. The standard _Save As_ dialog will appear where you can select the file name and format.

To export a tree image to a vector format select the _Save whole tree as SVG_ item in the _Export Tree Image_ submenu.

To copy a tree to the clipboard select the _Copy to clipboard_ submenu.
