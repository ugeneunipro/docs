The hotkey for this action is Alt+3.

It is possible to configure the _Log View_ settings, including the level of the log to display (ERROR, INFO, DETAILS, TRACE), the category (Algorithms, Tasks, etc.), and the format of the log messages (format of the dates, etc.). These settings can be configured in the UGENE [_Application Settings_](../ugene-application-settings/logging).
