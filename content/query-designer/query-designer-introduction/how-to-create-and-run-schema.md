**Result:** The constraint has been added to the elements:

**Result:** The _Run schema_ dialog appears:


![](/images/65930610/65930620.png)

*   Browse for the sequence to analyze (the _Load sequence_ field) and for a GenBank file to save results to (the _Save results to_ field). Click the _Run_ button.

**Result:** Both the sequence and the file with annotations are added to the current project. The sequence appears in the Sequence View window, for example:

To learn more about the Sequence View read main UGENE User Manual.

The schema described in this example is also available as sample schema. Select the _Samples_ tab on the _Palette_ and double-click the _ORF-Repeats_ to open the sample schema.
