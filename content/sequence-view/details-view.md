# Details View

The _Sequence details view_ is a supplementary component of the _Sequence overview_. It is used to show sequence content without zooming. Every time you double click the sequence in the _Sequence overview_ area or select an annotation, the corresponding sequence position is made visible in the _Sequence details view_.

For a DNA sequence the _Sequence details view_ automatically shows complement DNA strand and 6 amino translation frames.
