# Extracting Selected as MSA

It is possible to extract a subalignment and save it as new multiple sequence alignment (MSA).

Select a subalignment and choose the _Export ‣ Save subalignment_ item in the _Actions_ main menu or in the context menu. The following dialog appears:

Specify the name and format of the new MSA file in the _File name_ and _File format to use_ fields. The currently selected region is extracted by default when you press the _Extract_ button.

You can change the columns to be extracted using the _From_ and _to_ fields. And change the rows to be extracted by checking/unchecking required sequences in the _Selected sequences_ list.

Use buttons:

*   _Invert selection_ — to invert the selection of the sequences.
*   _Select all_ — to select all sequences.
*   _Clear selection_ — to clear the selection of all sequences.

The _Add to project_ check box specifies to add the MSA file created from the subalignment to the active project.
