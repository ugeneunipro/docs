# Show on Translation

This option is available for nucleotide sequences only. It specifies to show the annotation on the corresponding amino sequence instead of the original nucleotide sequence in the _Sequence Detailed View_, for example:

You can enable/disable this option by checking/unchecking the _Show on translation_ checkbox.
