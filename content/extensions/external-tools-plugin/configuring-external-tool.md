# Configuring External Tool

To configure an external tool:

1. Ensure the tool is installed on your system.
2. Set the path to the tool's executable file in UGENE. It can be set on the [_External Tools_](external-tools.md) tab of the _[Application Settings](ugene-application-settings.md)_ dialog.

If the path hasnâ€™t been set for a tool, UGENE menu items that launch the tool are displayed in italics. For example, in the image below, a path for the ClustalW external tool has been set, and paths for MAFFT and T-Coffee have not been set:
