# Selecting Restriction Enzymes

To select an enzyme, check it in the list. Notice that the enzyme appears in the _Selected enzymes_ area of the dialog.

You can also use the _Select All_ button to select all the enzymes available, and the _Select None_ button to deselect all the enzymes.

To select all enzymes with a recognition sequence length shorter than the specified value, click the _Select by length_ button and input the minimum length in the dialog that appears.

To invert the selection, click the _Invert selection_ button.

As soon as enzymes are selected, you can click the _OK_ button to search for corresponding restriction sites in the sequence.
