# Running Workflow

Once you are satisfied with the designed workflow and have it configured, click the _Run workflow_ button on the toolbar (alternatively, you can select the _Actions â€£ Run workflow_ item in the main menu or launch it by pressing Ctrl+R). The workflow gets verified and scheduled for background execution. If you continue editing the workflow, this will not affect the launched execution. You can control the workflow execution via the [_Task View_](/docs/workflow-designer/introduction/ugene-components-and-workflow-designer/task-view-notifications-and-log-view): watch progress, cancel it, etc. Upon completion, the Workflow Designer produces a _[dashboard](dashboard.md)_ with a summary report. The report displays the status of each iteration execution and provides other details.

Note that you can see the progress of a workflow execution in a Workflow Designer window by checking the _Track running progress on diagram_ option in the [_Application Settings_](../introduction/ugene-components-and-workflow-designer/application-settings) dialog:
