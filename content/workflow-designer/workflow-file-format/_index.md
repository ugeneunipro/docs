# Workflow File Format

Using the GUI is not the only way to create/edit a _workflow workflow_. A workflow is saved to a file with .uwl extension. The format of the file is human-readable. This chapter describes this format and explains how you can create/edit a workflow file using a text editor.

The best way to learn workflow workflow file format is to study an existent .uwl file. The file consists of the header and the body. Check the description of each part below.
