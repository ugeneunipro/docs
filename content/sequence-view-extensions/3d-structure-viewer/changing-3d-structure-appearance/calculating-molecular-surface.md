# Calculating Molecular Surface

To calculate the molecular surface of a molecule select the _Molecular Surface_ item in the 3D Structure Viewer context menu or in the _Display_ menu on the toolbar and check one of the following items:

*   _SAS_ (solvent-accessible surface)
*   _SES_ (solvent-excluded surface)
*   _vdWS_ (van der Waals surface)

To remove the molecular surface that has already been calculated select the _Off_ item.

You can also select the _Molecular Surface Render Style_ to modify the calculated molecular surface appearance:

*   _Convex Map_
*   _Dots_
