# Query Designer Window Components

Each _Query Designer_ window consists of:

**Palette**

The palette of the _elements_.

**Scene**

The main drawing scene is the place where _elements_ are constructed into a _schema_.

**Property Editor**

Provides information about a currently selected _element_ and allows configuring it.

On the image below you can see these components in a maximized _Query Designer_ window:

All these components are resizable and can be adjusted to individual needs.
