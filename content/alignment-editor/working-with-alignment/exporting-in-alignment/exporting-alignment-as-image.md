The Export Image dialog will appear, where you should set the name, location, export settings, and format of the picture:

You can export the whole alignment or a custom region. To select a custom region, click on the _Select_ button.

It is possible to select options such as _Include names_, _Include consensus_, and _Include rules_. When you select the Wrap mode button ![](/images/65929694/96665878.png) on the toolbar, the alignment is displayed on multiple lines. In this case, the _Based on each line option (multiline image)_ parameter is selected by default, and the image is displayed in wrap mode as well.

UGENE supports export to BMP, JPG, PNG, TIFF, and SVG image formats. Note the _Quality_ slider, which is present for the JPG format only.
