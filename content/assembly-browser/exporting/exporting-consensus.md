# Exporting Consensus

To export a consensus sequence of the assembly, select either the _Export consensus_ item in the _Consensus Area_ context menu or the _Export â€£ Consensus_ item in the _Reads Area_ context menu.

The _Export Consensus_ dialog will appear:

Select a file and the desired file format. The consensus can be exported to a FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, GenBank, UGENE Database, or Vector NTI sequence file.

Modify the exported sequence name if required, and choose the [_consensus algorithm_](../consensus-sequence).

The consensus is exported with gaps if the _Keep gaps_ check box is checked.

You can also select the region to export. It can be either the _Whole sequence_, a _Visible_ region, or a _Custom_ region.

When all the parameters are set, click the _Export_ button.

The consensus sequence is exported to the file, and if the _Add to project_ check box is checked, it is added to the current _project_ and opened.
