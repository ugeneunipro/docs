# PhyML Maximum Likelihood

The _Building Phylogenetic Tree_ dialog for the _PhyML Maximum Likelihood_ method has the following view:

The following parameters are available:

_Substitution model parameters_ - a selection of the Markov model of substitution:

_Substitution model_ - model of substitution.

_Equilibrium frequencies_ - equilibrium frequencies.

_Transition/transversion ratio_ - fix or estimate the transition/transversion ratio in the maximum likelihood framework.

_Proportion of invariable sites_ - the proportion of invariable sites, i.e., the expected frequency of sites that do not evolve, can be fixed or estimated.

_Number of substitution rate categories_ - the number of substitution rate categories.

_Gamma shape parameter_ - the shape of the gamma distribution determines the range of rate variation across sites.

_Branch support parameters_ - the selection of the method that is used to measure branch support:

_Use fast likelihood method_ - use fast likelihood method.

_Perform bootstrap_ - the support of the data for each internal branch of the phylogeny can be estimated using non-parametric bootstrap.

_Tree searching parameters_ - the selection of the tree topology searching algorithm:

_Make initial tree automatically_ - initial tree automatically.

_Type of tree improvement_ - type of tree improvement.

_Set number of random starting tree_ - the number of random starting tree.

_Optimize tree topology_ - the tree topology is optimised in order to maximise the likelihood.

_Optimize branch lengths_ - optimize branch lengths.

_Optimise substitution rate -_ substitution rate parameters are optimized.

_Display tree in new window_ - displays tree in the new window.

_Display tree with alignment editor_ - displays tree with alignment editor.

_Synchronize alignment with tree_ - synchronize alignment and tree.

_Save tree to_ - file to save the built tree.

Press the _Build_ button to run the analysis with the parameters selected and build a consensus tree.
