# Exporting Consensus

To export a consensus sequence of the assembly, select either the _Export consensus_ item in the _Consensus Area_ context menu or the _Export â€£ Consensus_ item in the _Reads Area_ context menu.

The _Export Consensus_ dialog appears:

Select a file and the file format. The consensus can be exported to a FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, GenBank, UGENE Database or Vector NTI sequence file.

Modify, if required, the exported sequence name and choose the [_consensus algorithm_](../consensus-sequence).

The consensus is exported with gaps if the _Keep gaps_ check box has been checked.

Also you can select the exporting region. It can be either a _Whole sequence_, a _Visible_ region, or a _Custom_ region.

When all the parameters are set click the _Export_ button.

The consensus sequence is exported to the file and if the _Add to project_ check box has been checked it is added to the current _project_ and opened.
