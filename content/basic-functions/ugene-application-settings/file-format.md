# File Format

![](/images/65929351/65929352.png)

The _Sequence Annotations_ settings allow the use of upper/lower case annotations during the file reading process.

Format options:

1.  _Don’t use case annotations_ (default mode) — Regular sequence reading and writing.
2.  _Use lower case annotation_ — Sequences are read and annotations with names _lower\_case_ are added. When these sequences are written to a file, the case remains the same as the original file (the case is preserved).
3.  _Use upper case annotation_ — There is similar behavior but with “upper\_case” annotations.
