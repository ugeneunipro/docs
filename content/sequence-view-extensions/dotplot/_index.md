# Dotplot

The _Dotplot_ plugin provides a tool to build dotplots for DNA or RNA sequences, enabling graphical comparison of these sequences. Using a dotplot, you can easily identify differences between sequences, such as mutations, inversions, insertions, deletions, and low-complexity regions.

Additionally, the plugin offers advanced features, including comparing multiple dotplots, navigation within a dotplot, dotplot synchronization, saving, and loading a dotplot, among others.

Here is an example of a dotplot view:

The _Dotplot_ plugin uses the [_Repeat Finder_](repeat-finder.md) plugin to build a dotplot, so make sure you have the _Repeat Finder_ plugin installed.

The _Dotplot_ features are described in more detail below.
