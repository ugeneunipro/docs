# Viewing Two Chromatograms Simultaneously

To add another sequence to the _Sequence View_, drag the required sequence object from the _Project View_ and drop it in the _Sequence View_ area. (Note that the dragged object is the sequence object, not the chromatogram object.)

The result will look like this:

You can also use the _Lock scales_ and _Adjust scales_ global actions for the chromatograms.

For example if you lock the scales you are able to scroll the sequences simultaneously. Also when you select a sequence region in one sequence, the same region is selected in the second sequence.
