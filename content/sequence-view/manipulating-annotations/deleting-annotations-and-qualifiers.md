# Deleting Annotations and Qualifiers

Selected annotations, groups and qualifiers can be deleted using the Delete key.

To remove an annotation object from the active view, select the object in the _Annotations editor_ and press the Shift-Delete. Note that the object will not be removed from the project, but just from the active _Sequence View_. To add object again just drag and drop it to the _Sequence View_.
