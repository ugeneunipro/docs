# 3D Structure Viewer

The 3D Structure Viewer is intended for the visualization of 3D structures of biological molecules.

Using the 3D Structure Viewer, you can work with data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) - a repository for the 3D structural data of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, maintained by the [Worldwide Protein Data Bank](http://www.wwpdb.org/) (wwPDB).

You can also work with data from the NCBI [Molecular Modeling Database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=structure) (MMDB), also known as “Entrez Structure”, a database of experimentally determined structures obtained from the [RCSB Protein Data Bank](http://www.pdb.org/).
