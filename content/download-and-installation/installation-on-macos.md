# Installation on macOS

The UGENE delivery type on macOS is a DMG installer. There are two options:

*   **Online installer:** Recommended, supports updates to new versions.
*   **Offline installer:** Does not require an Internet connection to be installed.

The current UGENE version is available for operating system version 10.7 or higher. Older UGENE packages are also provided for earlier OS versions.

All download links are available on the webpage [http://ugene.net/download-all.html](http://ugene.net/download-all.html).

### Configure System Preferences

It may be required to configure macOS settings to install UGENE:

*   Select "System Preferences -> Security & Privacy".
*   Unlock the settings to make changes.
*   Under "Allow apps downloaded from," select "Anywhere".
