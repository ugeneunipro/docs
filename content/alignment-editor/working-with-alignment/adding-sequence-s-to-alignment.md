Choose a file with the sequence(s) from the file system, and click _Open_.

Additionally, you can add an already opened sequence or sequences to the alignment. To do this, select the sequence object(s) in the [Project View](../../basic-functions/ugene-terminology) and click the _Align sequence to this alignment_ toolbar button. The sequence(s) will be aligned with the alignment automatically.
