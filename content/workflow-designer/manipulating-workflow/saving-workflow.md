# Saving Workflow

Choose _Actions ‣ Save workflow_ item in the main menu or _Save workflow_ toolbar button to save a workflow. The workflow is saved to a file of native UGENE format (with.uwl extension).

The format is human-readable, you can find it’s description in chapter [_Workflow File Format_](workflow-file-format.md).

There is Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut for this action.

If you save a workflow for the first time the _Workflow properties_ dialog appears:

Here you can browse for the workflow file _Location_ and specify the workflow _Name_ and _Comment_.

Once a workflow has been saved, it can be [_loaded_](loading-workflow). If you modify the loaded workflow and save changes, then corresponding .uwl file is modified.

To save the workflow with different properties choose the _Actions ‣ Save workflow as_ item in the main menu and specify the required settings in the _Workflow properties_ dialog.
