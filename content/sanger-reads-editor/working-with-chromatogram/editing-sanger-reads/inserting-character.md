# Inserting Character

To insert a nucleotide into a read in the _Sanger Reads Editor_, select a nucleotide or a gap in the corresponding location in the _Chromatogram Area_ and switch to the editing mode by pressing _Shift+I_, selecting _Edit_â€“>_Insert character/gap_ in the context menu, or selecting _Actions->Edit->Insert character/gap_ in the main menu. While the cursor is blinking, press a character on the keyboard that you want to insert. After that the editing mode is switched off.

Note that if you press the '-' character on the keyboard while being in the editing mode, a gap is inserted. The other way to insert a gap is by pressing _Space_, see the [Inserting Gap](inserting-gap.md) chapter.

You can always cancel the changes by pressing _Ctrl+Z_.
