# Exporting Sequence Image

Use the sequence toolbar's _Export image_ button to save a screenshot of the sequence:

![](/images/65929444/96665867.png)

The Export Image dialog will appear, where you should set the name, location, export settings, and format of the picture:

![](/images/65929444/96665870.png)

You can export _Currently viewed_, _Zoomed annotations_, or _Sequence details_ areas. For zoomed annotations and sequence details areas, you can export the whole sequence or a custom region. Use the _Region_ settings to do this. Here you can browse for the file name and image format: JPG, BMP, SVG, PNG, and TIFF. Pay attention to the _Quality_ slider, which is present for the JPG format only. Note that the SVG format is not supported for the _Currently viewed area._
