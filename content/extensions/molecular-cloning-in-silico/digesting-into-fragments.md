# Digesting into Fragments

Open a DNA molecule you wish to cut into fragments.

Digestion into fragments is performed using restriction enzymes. Before continuing, ensure that restriction analysis has been completed. Refer to the chapter [_Restriction Analysis_](restriction-analysis.md) for details.

Select either the _Tools ‣ Cloning ‣ Digest into Fragments_ option, the _Actions ‣ Cloning ‣ Digest into Fragments_ option in the main menu, or the _Cloning ‣ Digest into Fragments_ option in the context menu.

The _Digest Sequence into Fragments_ dialog appears:

On the _Restriction Sites_ tab of the dialog, you can see the name of the molecule, the list of restriction enzymes found during the restriction analysis capable of cutting the molecule, and the list of enzymes selected to perform the digestion.

To digest the sequence into fragments, you must select at least one enzyme.

To move an enzyme to the _Selected enzymes_ list, click on it in the _Available enzymes_ list and press the _Add_ button. Note that you can select multiple items in a list by holding the Ctrl key while clicking on the items.

To select all available enzymes, press the _Add All_ button.

To remove enzymes from the _Selected enzymes_ list, select them in the list and press the _Remove_ button.

To remove all items from the _Selected enzymes_ list, press the _Clear Selection_ button.

On the _Conserved Annotations_ tab of the dialog, you can select the annotations that must not be disrupted during cloning.

On the _Output_ tab of the dialog, you can choose the file to save the new molecule to.

Once the necessary parameters are selected, press the _OK_ button. The fragments will be saved as annotations.

Additionally, all the generated fragments are available in the task report:
