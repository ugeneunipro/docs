&lt;p>This workflow predicts binding sites for a number of transcription factors of interest using the SITECON algorithm. The current workflow sample is designed for the simultaneous recognition of binding sites for three different transcription factor types. You can expand it for the recognition of any desired number of transcription factor types. SITECON is a program package for the recognition of potential transcription factor binding sites based on the data about conservative conformational and physicochemical properties revealed from the analysis of binding site sets.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
