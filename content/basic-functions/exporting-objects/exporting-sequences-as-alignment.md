# Exporting Sequences as Alignment

The _Export Sequences as Alignment_ dialog will appear where you can point the result alignment file location, to select a multiple alignment file format, to use Genbank “SOURCE” tags as a name of sequences for Genbank sequences and optionally add the created document to the current project:
