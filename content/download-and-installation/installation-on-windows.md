# Installation on Windows

The following types of UGENE package deliveries are available on Windows:

* **Online installer:** Recommended, updates to new versions are supported.
* **Offline installer:** Does not require an Internet connection to install. Extra configuration is required for additional NGS components for ChIP-Seq and metagenomic data analysis.

The current UGENE version is available for Windows 8 and higher on a 64-bit platform.

For other Windows versions, older UGENE versions are available on the webpage [http://ugene.net/download-all.html](http://ugene.net/download-all.html).
