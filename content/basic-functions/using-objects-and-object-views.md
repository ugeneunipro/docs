# Using Objects and Object Views

The document always contains one or more _objects_. An _object_ is a structured biological data that can be visualized by different _Object Views_.

A single _Object View_ can visualize one or several objects of different types. For example a single view can show a sequence, annotations for the sequence, 3D model for the part of the sequence or its chromatogram simultaneously.

The type of an object is indicated by the symbol in the square brackets and the icon near the object:

Below is the list of object types supported by the current version of UGENE.

A phylogenetic tree.



You can edit names of particular objects, such as sequence objects, by selecting them in the _Project View_ and then pressing F2. To be able to do so, the document containing the target object must be unlocked.

To see the list of all available views for a given object select the object and activate the context menu inside the _Project View_ window and select the _Open In_ submenu:

The picture above illustrates an option to visualize the selected DNA sequence object using the _Sequence View_ â€” a complex and extensible _Object View_ that focuses on visualization of sequence objects in combination with different kinds of related data: sequence annotations, graphs, chromatograms, sequence analysis algorithms. Note, that the _Sequence View_ is described in more details in the separate [_documentation section_](sequence-view.md).
