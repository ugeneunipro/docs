# Opening for the First Time

To open a _document_ that is not yet presented in the current _project_ use either an advanced _Open_ dialog, a simple open file dialog or just drag the document to the UGENE window.

UGENE automatically detects the _format_ of the _document_, but if you use the advanced dialog you can choose the format manually.

To open the advanced dialog select one of the following:

*   _Add ‣ Existing document_ item in the [_Project View_](project-view.md) context menu
*   _File ‣ Open As_ item in the main menu

To simply open the document select one of the following:

*   _Open_ item in the main toolbar
*   _File ‣ Open_ item in the main menu

or drag the file to the UGENE window. Also it is able to drag and drop documents (not objects) between opened UGENEs.

Documents created not by UGENE are [_locked_](http://ugene.unipro.ru/documentation/manual/basic_functions/locked_documents.html#locked-documents). To be able to edit the document you should save a copy of the document and continue working with the copy.
