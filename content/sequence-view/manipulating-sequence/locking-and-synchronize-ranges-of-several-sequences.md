# Locking and Synchronizing Ranges of Several Sequences

An important feature of the _Sequence Zoom View_ is the ability to synchronize and lock visual ranges of different sequences shown in the _Sequence View_.

This feature is available when there are two or more sequences opened in the same _Sequence View_.

If you click the _Lock Scales_ button, the scale of the second sequence will be adjusted to match the scale of the focused sequence and will be locked. Now, if you move a scrollbar or use zoom buttons for any of the sequences, the visual ranges for the other sequences will also be adjusted.

To unlock the scales, click the same button again.

You may use the _Adjust Scales_ button to synchronize scales without locking them.

Note that if you have a selected sequence region or a selected annotation, the scales will be synchronized by the start position of the region or annotation. If there are no active selections, the regions are synchronized by the first visible sequence position on the screen.
