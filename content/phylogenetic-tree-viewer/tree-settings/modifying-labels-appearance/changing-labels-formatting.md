# Changing Labels Formatting

To change the formatting of the tree labels, select the _Labels Formatting_ toolbar button or the _Tree Settings Options Panel_ tab:

![](/images/65929735/65929736.png)

Here, you can select the color, font, size, and attributes (bold, italic, etc.) of the labels.

Note that when [_a clade has been selected_](../../working-with-clade/selecting-clade), the label formatting settings are applied only to that clade.
