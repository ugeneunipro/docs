# Assembly Overview Description

The _Assembly Overview_ provides a coverage overview of the assembly. The longer the depth of a line in the overview and the deeper the color, the more reads are located in that region.

To open a region of the assembly in the _Reads Area_, click on it in the Assembly Overview. In the overview, the selected region is displayed as either a gray rectangle, a red cross, or a red rectangle. For example:

If you hold Shift and select a region on the overview, the overview is zoomed into the selection.

Note that when the Assembly Overview is in focus, using either the zoom buttons on the toolbar, the zoom items in the _Actions_ main menu, or a mouse wheel will appropriately resize the Reads Area.

The Assembly Overview can also be resized. To zoom in the overview, select either the _Zoom in_ or the _Zoom in 100x_ item in the Assembly Overview context menu. You can scroll the resized overview by dragging the mouse while pressing down the mouse wheel. To zoom out of the overview, select the _Zoom out_ item in the context menu. The _Restore global overview_ item in the context menu restores the default overview size when the entire contig overview is shown.

Notice that the Assembly Overview shows the coordinates of the assembly areas visible in both the Reads Area and in the Assembly Overview:
