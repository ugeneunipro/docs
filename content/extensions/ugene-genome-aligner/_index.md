# UGENE Genome Aligner

The [UGENE Genome Aligner](http://ugene.unipro.ru/benchmarks/UGENE_Genome_Aligner_SPO_2011.pdf) is a fast short-read aligner. It aligns DNA sequences of various lengths to the reference genome with a configurable mismatch rate.

It is available from the _Tools â€£ NGS data analysis_ submenu of the main menu.

Select the _Map reads to reference_ item to align short reads to a DNA sequence, or the _Build index for reads mapping_ item to build an index for a DNA sequence, which can be used to optimize aligning short reads to the sequence.
