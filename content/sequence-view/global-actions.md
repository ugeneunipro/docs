# Global Actions


![](/images/65929375/65929376.png)

The global action toolbar provides possibility to go to the specified position (in all sequences at the same time).

Also it allows to lock or adjust ranges of sequences in the same _Sequence View_. See [_this paragraph_](manipulating-sequence/locking-and-synchronize-ranges-of-several-sequences) for details.
