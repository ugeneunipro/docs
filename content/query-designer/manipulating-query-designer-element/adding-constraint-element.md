# Adding Constraint Element

A constraint can be imposed on any two _algorithm elements_.

To add a _constraint element_ drag it from the _Palette_ to the _Scene_. The corresponding dialog appears:

Once the _algorithm elements_ are selected and the _OK_ button is pressed in the dialog, the _constraint element_ is added to the _Scene_. From now the constraint is binded to the _algorithm elements_ and it is not possible to modify this assignment.
