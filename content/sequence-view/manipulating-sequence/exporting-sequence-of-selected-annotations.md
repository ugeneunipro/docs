# Exporting Sequence of Selected Annotations

Open the _Sequence View_ with a document that contains annotations. A good candidate could be any file in Genbank format with both sequence and annotations. Select one or several annotations or annotation groups in the _Annotation Editor_, click the right mouse button to open the context menu, and select the _Export â€£ Export sequence of selected annotations_ item:

The _Export Sequence of Selected Annotations_ dialog will appear, which is similar to the _Export Selected Sequences_ dialog described [_here_](../../basic-functions/exporting-objects/exporting-sequences-to-sequence-format).
