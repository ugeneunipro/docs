# Selecting Alignment Region

### Selection in the Alignment Editor components

In the _Name List_ and the _Sequence Area_ selection is visualized as a rectangle with a dashed border. In the _Consensus Area_ the consensus sequence character of the corresponding columns are shown with light gray background:

### Selecting a region using the mouse and keyboard shortcuts

Using the mouse one can select:

*   Several consequent sequences in the _Name List_.
*   Several consequent columns in the _Consensus Area_.
*   An alignment region in the _Sequence Area_.

By holding the _Shift_ key it is possible to select a region between two coordinates of a mouse click. For example, if there is a big alignment, one can click on a character (the left upper coordinate of the region), press _Shift_, scroll to the required location of the alignment, and click on another character (the right bottom coordinate of the region).

It is possible to modify a selection in the _Sequence Area_ by dragging the selection rectangle border:

Press the _Esc_ key to clear the selection.
