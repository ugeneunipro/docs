# Adding New Sequences

You can add new sequences to an alignment using the _Add_ submenu in the _Actions_ main menu or the context menu.

There are two ways to add a new sequence to the current alignment:

*   From a file in the compatible format (FASTA, GenBank etc.). The list of the supported data formats can be found [_here_](Appendix-A.supported-file-formats.md).

*   From the current project.


If you activate this item, the following dialog will appear:

You will see the _Project View_ tree filtered to show only appropriate sequences. Select the items to add and press the _Ok_ button.
