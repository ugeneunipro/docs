&lt;p>This sample describes how to identify sequences with the specified number of annotations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the schema reads sequences input by a user. Then, each sequence is marked either with the &amp;ldquo;Good&amp;rdquo; or with the &amp;ldquo;Rest&amp;rdquo; mark, depending on the number of the sequence annotations. After marking, the sequences are filtered by the marks. And finally, the filtered sequences are written into files, specified by a user.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marking by Length</title><link>https://ugene.net/docs/workflow-designer/workflow-samples/data-marking/marking-by-length/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ugene.net/docs/workflow-designer/workflow-samples/data-marking/marking-by-length/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="marking-by-length">Marking by Length&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This sample describes how to identify sequences with the specified length.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the workflow reads sequences input by a user. Then, each sequence is marked either with the “Short” or with the “Long” mark, depending on the sequence length. After marking, the sequences are filtered by the marks. And finally, the filtered sequences are written into files, specified by a user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, a sequence with a length 200 or less bp is marked as “Short”. A sequence with a length of more than 200 bp is marked as “Long”. You can configure this value in the &lt;a href="sequence-marker-element.md">&lt;em>Sequence Marker&lt;/em>&lt;/a> element parameters.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
