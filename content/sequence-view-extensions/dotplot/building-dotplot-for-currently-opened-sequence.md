# Building Dotplot for Currently Opened Sequence

To build a dotplot for currently opened sequences, create a multiple view containing these sequences. It can be arranged by dragging the corresponding sequence objects (the items strated with the “\[s\]”) into the same _Sequence View_.

Then right-click on the created view and select the _Analyze ‣ Build dotplot_ item in the context menu. Every sequence from the current multiple sequence view can be used to build a dotplot.

If you need to compare a sequence with itself, you can activate the menu from a single _Sequence View_.
