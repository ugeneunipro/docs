# System Requirements

#### **Operating system**

Since v. 34, 64-bit versions of the operating systems are supported only:

*   Windows 8+
*   macOS 10.7+
*   Linux

Note that some external tools may be available only on particular operating systems, see details in the "[Data Analysis Tools](data-analysis-tools.md)" chapter of the manual.

For older packages, if required, see [http://ugene.net/download-all.html](http://ugene.net/download-all.html).

#### **RAM**

512 Mb RAM is required. At least 2 Gb RAM is recommended.

#### **Disk space**

The minimum required disk space depends on the installed UGENE components. At least 1 Gb is recommended. For installing all components, including NGS modules for ChIP-seq and metagenomic data processing, about 250Gb is required.

#### **Display**

It is recommended to set the screen resolution to 1280 x 720 or greater.

#### **Internet**

Internet connection is required for a few tasks like loading data from online databases.


UGENE takes care to use the capabilities of your system: the more RAM and cores you have, the more quickly you'll get results of your calculations.
