# Replacing Selected Character

To replace a symbol in the alignment select the nucleotide and press _Shift+R_ for switching the edit mode on.

 While the selection is blinking, press a keyboard character that you want to replace the nucleotide with.

 After that the edit mode is switched off. For replacing another nucleotide press _Shift+R_ again.

 You always can cancel the changes pressing _Ctrl+Z_.
