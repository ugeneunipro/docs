# Output

On the _Output_ tab of the dialog, you can select the file to save the new molecule to.

The molecule is opened by default as soon as it is created. To modify this behavior, uncheck the _Open view for new molecule_ checkbox on the same tab.

To save the molecule file to the hard disk immediately after it is created, check the _Save immediately_ checkbox. Otherwise, it will be stored in memory until you save or remove it.
