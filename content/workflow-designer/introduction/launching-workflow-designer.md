The output directory is a common directory that is used to store all output files in the Workflow Designer. If this directory is used, then a separate subdirectory of the directory is created for each run of a workflow. You can change this option in the [_Application Settings_](application-settings.md) dialog.

The tool provides multi-window user interface, so you can open and use at the same time as many Workflow Designer windows as you need.
