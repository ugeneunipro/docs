# Assemble Reads with SPAdes Element

Performers assembly of input short reads.

**Element type:** spades-id

Input data

Select the type of input for SPAdes. URL(s) to the input files of the selected type(s) should be provided to the corresponding port(s) of the workflow element.

At least one library of the following types is required:

*   Illumina paired-end/high-quality mate-pairs/unpaired reads
*   IonTorrent paired-end/high-quality mate-pairs/unpaired reads
*   PacBio CCS reads (at least 5 reads coverage is recommended)

It is strongly suggested to provide multiple paired-end and mate-pair libraries according to their insert size (from smallest to longest).

Additionally, one may input Oxford Nanopore reads, Sanger reads, contigs generated by other assembler(s), etc. Note that Illumina and IonTorrent libraries should not be assembled together. All other types of input data are compatible.

It is also possible to set up reads orientation (forward-reverse (fr), reverse-forward (rf), forward-forward (ff)) and specify whether paired reads are separate or interlaced.

Illumina, IonTorrent or PacBio CCS reads should be provided in FASTQ format.
Illumina or PacBio read may also be provided in FASTA format. Error correction should be skipped in this case (see the "Running mode" parameter).
Sanger, Oxford Nanopore, and PacBio CLR reads can be provided in both formats since SPAdes does not run error correction for these types of data.

To configure input data use the following button:
