The _Export Selected Sequences_ dialog will appear for amino sequence:

Here you can select the location of the result file and a sequence file format. You can choose to add newly created document to the current project and use custom sequence name. To do it check the corresponding checkboxes.

Use the _Conversion options_ to choose a strand for saving sequence(s). Also you can translate sequence(s) to amino/nucleic alphabet.

Also it is possible to specify whether to merge the exported sequences into a single sequence or store them as separate sequences. If you merge the sequences, you’re allowed to select the gap symbols between sequences. This is the length of the insertion region between sequences that contain **N** symbols for nucleic or **X** for protein sequences.

#### Export sequence with annotations

To export sequence with annotations choose Genbank or GFF format. The _Export with annotations_ checkbox will ba available. Check the checkbox and sequence will be exported with annotations .
