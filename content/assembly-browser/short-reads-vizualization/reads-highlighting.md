# Reads Highlighting

To apply a reads highlighting mode, select it in the _Reads highlighting_ menu of the _Reads Area_ context menu or on the _Assembly Browser Settings_ tab of the _Options Panel_. The following modes are available:

*   _Nucleotide_ — shows all nucleotides in different colors. It is used by default.

*   _Difference_ — highlights gaps and nucleotides that differ from the reference sequence. You should add a reference first for correct displaying of this highlighting.
