# Creating Fragment

To create a DNA fragment from a sequence region activate the _Sequence View_ window and select either the _Actions ‣ Cloning ‣ Create Fragment_ item in the main menu or the _Cloning ‣ Create Fragment_ item in the context menu.

The _Create DNA Fragment_ dialog appears:

If a region has been selected you can choose to create the fragment from this region. Otherwise you can either choose to create the fragment from the whole sequence or choose the _Custom_ item and input the custom region.

To add a 5’ overhang to the direct strand check the _Include Left Overhang_ check box and input the required nucleotides. To add a 5’ overhang to the reverse strand in addition to the described steps select the _Reverse-complement_ item in the same group box.

Similarly, to add a 3’ overhang check the _Include Right Overhang_ check box, input the required overhang and select either the direct or the reverse-complement strand.

On the _Output_ tab of the dialog you can optionally modify the annotations output settings.

Finally, press the _OK_ button to create the fragment. The fragment will be saved as an annotation.
