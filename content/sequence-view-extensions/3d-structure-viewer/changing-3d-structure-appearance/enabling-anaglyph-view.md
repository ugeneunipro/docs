# Enabling Anaglyph View

UGENE allows you to view a molecule in the anaglyph mode. To enable the anaglyph view open the _Settings_ dialog of the 3D Structure Viewer and check the _Anaglyph view_ check box.

You can modify the color settings: select one of the available _Glasses colors_ or set custom colors, swap the colors.

The offset of the color layers can be adjusted by dragging the _Eyes shift_ slider.
