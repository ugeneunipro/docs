# Schema Elements

The _Scene_ is initially empty and you start with creating a _schema_ on it:

**schema**

A schema is a visual representation of the query that would be used to analyze a nucleotide sequence. It consists of _elements_.

**element**

An element of a _schema_. There are two types of elements: _algorithm elements_ and _constraint elements_.

**algorithm element**

An element of a _schema_ that represents an algorithm used to analyze a nucleotide sequence.

**constraint element**

An element of a _schema_ used to impose constraints on the results obtained from _algorithm elements_.

Your first step is to [_add necessary algorithm elements_](adding-algorithm-element.md) to the _Scene_ by dragging them to the _Palette_.

The next step is to [_add constraints_](adding-constraint-element.md) on the algorithms results.
