# Adding Element

There are several ways to add an [_element_](workflow-elements-and-connections.md) to the [_Scene_](workflow-designer-window-components.md).

The easiest way is to drag the required element from the [_Palette_](workflow-designer-window-components.md) to the Scene. Or you can just click on the element on the Palette and then click somewhere on the Scene.

Also you can select an element in the _Add item_ submenu of the _Actions_ main menu or of the Scene context menu, for example:

![](/images/2097157/2359309.png)

When the required element is selected click somewhere on the Scene to insert it.
