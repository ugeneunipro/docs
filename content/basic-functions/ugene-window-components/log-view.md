The hotkey for this action is Alt+3.

It is possible to configure the _Log View_ settings: the level of the log to show (ERROR, INFO, DETAILS, TRACE) , the category (Algrorithms, Tasks, etc.), and the format of the log messages (format of the dates, etc.). This settings can be configured in the UGENE [_Application Settings_](logging.md).
