Alternatively, you can press _Edit_ to modify the script that specifies the separator for each parsed line. It is possible to use the line number in the script.

The annotation start and end positions must be specified. It is possible to add an offset to every read start position by checking the _Add offset_ checkbox, and to shorten annotations by one from the end by unchecking the _Inclusive_ checkbox.

When all the roles are specified, press _Run_. With the _Add to project_ checkbox checked and a _Sequence View_ opened, if successful, you will see the _Sequence View_ with annotations linked:
