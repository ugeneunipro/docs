&lt;p>This sample describes how to identify sequences with a specified number of annotations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the schema reads sequences input by a user. Then, each sequence is marked with either the &amp;ldquo;Good&amp;rdquo; mark or the &amp;ldquo;Rest&amp;rdquo; mark, depending on the number of annotations in the sequence. After marking, the sequences are filtered by the marks. Finally, the filtered sequences are written into files specified by the user.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marking by Length</title><link>https://ugene.net/docs/workflow-designer/workflow-samples/data-marking/marking-by-length/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ugene.net/docs/workflow-designer/workflow-samples/data-marking/marking-by-length/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="marking-by-length">Marking by Length&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This sample describes how to identify sequences with a specified length.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the workflow reads sequences inputted by a user. Then, each sequence is marked either as “Short” or “Long,” depending on the sequence&amp;rsquo;s length. After marking, the sequences are filtered by these marks. Finally, the filtered sequences are written into files as specified by the user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, a sequence with a length of 200 base pairs (bp) or less is marked as “Short.” A sequence longer than 200 bp is marked as “Long.” You can configure this value in the &lt;a href="../../workflow-elements/data-flow/sequence-marker-element">&lt;em>Sequence Marker&lt;/em>&lt;/a> element parameters.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
