# Query Designer Window Components

Each _Query Designer_ window consists of:

**Palette**

The palette contains the available _elements_.

**Scene**

The main drawing scene is where _elements_ are assembled into a _schema_.

**Property Editor**

This component provides information about the currently selected _element_ and allows you to configure it.

In the image below, you can see these components in a maximized _Query Designer_ window:

All these components are resizable and can be adjusted to individual needs.
