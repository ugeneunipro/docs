# Moving Subalignment

To move subalignment there are different ways:

1.  Select a subalignment and drag and drop it. The subalignment will be moved.
2.  With a help of the _Space,_ the subalignment will be moved to the right by the size of the selection. With a help of the _Backspace_, the subalignment will be returned to the first state.
3.  With a help of the _Ctrl+Space,_ the subalignment will be moved to the right by one column. With a help of the _Ctrl +_ _Backspace_, the subalignment will be returned to the first state.
4.  With a help of the _Ctrl_, you can join the parts of alignment. When there is a fragment of characters, surrounded by gaps in a row, select continuous block without gaps on _Ctrl_ pressed and move the selection to the right/left.
