# Building HMM2 Model

_HMM build_ tool is used to build a new HMM profile from a multiple alignment.

You can use any alignment file formats supported by UGENE. The output HMM profile format is compatible with the HMMER2 package.

The _HMM build_ tool does not automatically calibrate a profile. Use the [_HMM calibrate_](calibrating-hmm2-model) tool to calibrate the profile.
