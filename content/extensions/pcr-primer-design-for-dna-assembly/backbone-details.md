# Backbone Details

If hairpins, self- or hetero-dimers have been identified in the backbone sequence, this dialog appears.

This dialog displays the backbone sequence and any unwanted connections that have been found. It then asks whether you still want to use this sequence as a backbone. If you click "Yes," this sequence will be used as the backbone. If you click "No," the next sequence from the backbone file will be checked. If you click "No" and there are no more sequences, the "Backbone" parameter will be skipped.
