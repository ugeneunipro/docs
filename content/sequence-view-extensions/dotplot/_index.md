# Dotplot

The _Dotplot_ plugin provides a tool to build dotplots for DNA or RNA sequences. This allows comparing these sequences graphically. Using a dotplot, you can easily identify such differences between sequences as mutations, inversions, insertions, deletions and low-complexity regions.

Also the plugin provides advanced features: comparing multiple dotplots, navigation in a dotplot, dotplots synchronization, saving and loading a dotplot, etc.

An example of a dotplot view:

The _Dotplot_ plugin uses the [_Repeat Finder_](repeat-finder.md) plugin to build a dotplot, make sure you have the _Repeat Finder_ plugin installed.

The _Dotplot_ features are described in more details below.
