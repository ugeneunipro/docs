# Other Constuction Options

To save the fragments of the new molecule as annotations check the _Annotate fragments in new molecule_ check box.

To make all DNA ends blunt check the _Force “blunt” and omit all overhangs_ check box. All overhangs would be cut in this case.

Check the _Make circular_ check box to make the new molecule circular.
