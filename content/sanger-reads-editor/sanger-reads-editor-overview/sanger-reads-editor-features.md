# Sanger Reads Editor Features

The Sanger Reads Editor is dedicated to DNA sequence analysis and manipulation. You can trim, map to reference, and view Sanger sequencing trace files, as well as create consensus sequences.

The editor provides an interactive visual representation that includes:

*   Navigation through a chromatogram;
*   Flexible zooming;
*   Several consensus calculation algorithms.

Using the _Sanger Reads Editor_, you can:

*   Export alignment without chromatograms;
*   Edit chromatograms: remove, replace, or trim them.
