# Exporting Documents

If a document has a format that supports writing in UGENE (see the [_Supported File Formats_](Appendix-A.supported-file-formats.md) chapter), you can export the document to a new document in a required format.

To do it use the _Export document_ item in the context menu:

Here you may select the name of the output file in the _Save to file_ field and, optionally, choose the format of the output file in the _File format_ field.Use the _Compress file_ checkbox to compress the file.The _Add to project_ checkbox, checked by default, adds the output file to the current project.
After choosing all parameters click the _Export_ button.
