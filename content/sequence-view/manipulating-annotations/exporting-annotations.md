# Exporting Annotations

To export annotations, open the _Sequence View_ with a document that contains annotations. Select a single annotation, multiple annotations, or annotation groups in the _Annotation Editor_, then select the _Export ‣ Export annotations_ context menu item.

Additionally, you can export annotations from the _Project View_ using the _Export ‣ Export annotations_ context menu item.

The _Export Annotations_ dialog will appear:

Here, you can add the document to the project, set the path to the file, choose the file format, and optionally, for CSV format, you can save the sequence along with the annotations and save sequence names.
