# Removing All Columns of Gaps

Use the _Shift+Del_ shortcut or _Edit â€£ Remove all columns of gaps_ option in the _Actions_ main menu or in the context menu to remove all columns of gaps from the alignment. This can be useful, for example, when an insertion in a read turned out not to be real, was replaced by a gap, and resulted in a column of gaps left in the alignment.
