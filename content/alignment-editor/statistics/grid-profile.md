# Grid Profile

Using the _Alignment Editor_, you can create a statistical profile of a multiple sequence alignment.

The alignment grid profile displays positional amino acid or nucleotide counts, highlighted according to the frequency of symbols in a row.

To create a grid profile, use the _Statistics â€£ Generate grid profile_ option in the _Actions_ main menu or in the context menu.

To learn more about this feature, refer to the [_DNA Statistics_](../../extensions/dna-statistics) plugin documentation.
