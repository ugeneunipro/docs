# Import BAM and SAM Files

To start working with an assembly import it to the UGENE database file. To do this, [_open_](opening-document.md) the assembly file.

For assembly file without header you can select the file with the reference sequence, otherwise the header information will be generated automatically.

Select if you want the referense sequence and click _Import_ button.

For other assembly files the following dialog appears:

The _Source URL_ field in the dialog specifies the file to import. The _Info_ button nearby can be used to obtain additional information about the file.

There is a list of contigs below the _Source URL_. Check the contigs that you want to import to the database. You can use the _Select All_, _Deselect All_ and _Invert Selection_ buttons to manage the selection.

The _Destination URL_ field specifies the output database file.

If you check the _Import unmapped reads_, then all unmapped reads in the assembly (i.e. read with the unmapped flag or without CIGAR) are imported. Note, however, that they are not vizualized in the current UGENE version.

To start the import, click the _Import_ button in the dialog. You can see the progress of the import in the [_Task View_](http://ugene.unipro.ru/documentation/manual/basic_functions/ugene_terminology.html#term-task-view). To export a UGENE database file into the SAM format, select the _Actions â€£ Export assembly to SAM format_ item in the main menu.
