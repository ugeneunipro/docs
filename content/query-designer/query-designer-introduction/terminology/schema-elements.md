# Schema Elements

The _Scene_ is initially empty, and you start by creating a _schema_ on it.

**Schema**

A schema is a visual representation of the query used to analyze a nucleotide sequence. It consists of _elements_.

**Element**

An element of a _schema_. There are two types of elements: _algorithm elements_ and _constraint elements_.

**Algorithm Element**

An element of a _schema_ that represents an algorithm used to analyze a nucleotide sequence.

**Constraint Element**

An element of a _schema_ used to impose constraints on the results obtained from _algorithm elements_.

Your first step is to [_add necessary algorithm elements_](../../manipulating-query-designer-element/adding-algorithm-element) to the _Scene_ by dragging them to the _Palette_.

The next step is to [_add constraints_](../../manipulating-query-designer-element/adding-constraint-element) on the algorithm results.
