# Build HMM from Alignment and test it

This workflow builds a new profile HMM from input alignment, calibrates the HMM and saves to a file. Then runs a test
HMM search over sample sequence and saves test results to Genbank file.

## How to Use This Sample

If you haven't used the workflow samples in UGENE before, look at
the "[How to Use Sample Workflows](../../introduction/how-to-use-sample-workflows)" section of the documentation.

##### Workflow Sample Location

The workflow sample "Build HMM from Alignment and test it" can be found in the "HMMER" section of the Workflow Designer
samples.

##### Workflow Image

The workflow looks as follows:

##### Workflow Wizard

The wizard has 4 pages.

### 1. Input MSA(s)

On this page you must input MSA(s).

### 3. HMM build

On this page you can modify HMM build parameters.

The following parameters are available:

| Parameter                | Description                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Output HMM profile**   | Location of output data file. If this attribute is set, slot "Location" in port will not be used.                           |
| **HMM strategy**         | Specifies kind of alignments you want to allow.                                                                             |
| **Profile name**         | Descriptive name of the HMM profile.                                                                                        |
| **Calibrate profile**    | Enables/disables optional profile calibration. Calibration increases sensitivity of database search.                        |
| **Parallel calibration** | Number of parallel threads for calibration.                                                                                 |
| **Fixed length**         | Fix length of generated random sequences. Default is to use various lengths from Gaussian distribution.                     |
| **Mean length**          | Mean length of synthetic sequences. Default: 325.                                                                           |
| **Number of samples**    | Number of synthetic sequences. Default: 5000. Too few may fail EVD fitting; more improves accuracy.                         |
| **Standard deviation**   | Standard deviation of sequence lengths. Default: 200. Gaussian is left-truncated (no zero-lengths).                         |
| **Random seed**          | Random seed. Use positive integer for reproducible results. By default, current time is used, so results vary between runs. |

### 4. HMM search

On this page you can modify HMM search and output parameters.

![](/images/65930303/65930308.png)

The following parameters are available:

| Parameter                  | Description                                                                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Output genbank**         | Location of output data file. If set, port "Location" is not used.                  |
| **Accumulate results**     | Combine all results into one file or create separate files (with numeric suffixes). |
| **Result annotation**      | Name of the result annotations.                                                     |
| **Number of seqs**         | Calculate E-values as if the sequence DB had this many entries.                     |
| **Filter by high E-value** | Use E-value threshold to exclude low-probability hits.                              |
| **Filter by low score**    | Alternative to E-value filtering â€” excludes low-score hits.                         |
