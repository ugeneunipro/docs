# Excluding Region

To exclude a sequence region from the search, check the _Exclude region_ checkbox and input the start and end positions of the region. If a subsequence has been selected before opening the dialog, you will see the _Selected region_ field, which will be automatically filled with the start and end positions of the selected subsequence.
